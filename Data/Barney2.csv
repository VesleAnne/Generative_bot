Barney," (on the phone) hey, so you know how I've always had a thing for half-Asian girls? Well, now I've got a new favorite: Lebanese girls! Lebanese girls are the new half-Asians."," What was I doing? Your Uncle Marshall was taking the biggest step of his life, and me-I'm calling your Uncle, Barney.  Hey, you wanna do something tonight?"
Barney," Okay, meet me at the bar in fifteen minutes, and Suit up!Scene Two"," Hey, you wanna do something tonight?  Hey."
Barney," Where's your suit!? Just once when I say suit up, I wish you'd put on a suit.", Hey.  I did that one time.
Barney, It was a blazer!," I did that one time.  You know, ever since college it's been Marshall and Lily and me. Now it's going to be Marshall and Lily... and me. They'll get married, start a family-before long I'm the weird, middle-aged bachelor their kids call Uncle Ted."
Barney, I see what this is about. Have you forgotten what I said to you the night we met?," You know, ever since college it's been Marshall and Lily and me. Now it's going to be Marshall and Lily... and me. They'll get married, start a family-before long I'm the weird, middle-aged bachelor their kids call Uncle Ted.  Ted, I'm going to teach you how to live. (Ted's shocked) Barney, we met at the urinal."
Barney," Ted, I'm going to teach you how to live. (Ted's shocked) Barney, we met at the urinal."," I see what this is about. Have you forgotten what I said to you the night we met?  Oh, right. Hi."
Barney," Lesson one, lose the goatee. It doesn't look good with your suit."," Oh, right. Hi.  I'm not wearing a suit."
Barney," Lesson two, get a suit. Suits are cool. (Points to self with bear bottle in hand) Exhibit A. (Flirts to a woman unseen) Lesson three, don't even think about getting married till you're... thirty."," I'm not wearing a suit.  Thirty, right. You're right. I guess it's just, you're best friend gets engaged-you start thinking about that stuff."
Barney," I thought I was your best friend. Ted, say I'm your best friend."," Thirty, right. You're right. I guess it's just, you're best friend gets engaged-you start thinking about that stuff.  You're my best friend, Barney."
Barney," Good! And as your best friend, I suggest we play a little game called... Have you met Ted?"," You're my best friend, Barney.  Wai-no, no, no. We're not playing Have You Met Ted?"
Barney," (Taps a woman names Yasmine) Hi, have you met Ted? (Leaves and watches from a distance)."," Wai-no, no, no. We're not playing Have You Met Ted?  (To Yasmine) Hi, I'm Ted."
Barney, (ignoring) how does Carl land a Lebanese girl?, Why am I freaking out all of a sudden? This is crazy! I'm not ready to settle down.  It's always been don't even think about it till you're thirty
Barney, Exactly-the guy doesn't even own a suit!," It's always been don't even think about it till you're thirty  Plus Marshall's found the love of his life. Even if I was ready, which I'm not, but if I was it's like, Okay, I'm ready! Where is she? (Spots Robin)"
Barney," (to Robin) Hey, have you met Ted?"," Hey Barney, see that girl?  Let me guess, (points) Ted?"
Barney, (comes back laughing) De-wait for it-nied! Denied!," (stops) Yeah, (agrees) What the hell (passes number to Ted. Throws drink on Ted's face) JERK! (Walks away. Whispers) that was fun.  We're going out tomorrow night."
Barney, I thought we were playing laser tag tomorrow night?," We're going out tomorrow night.  Yeah, I was never going to go play laser tag. (Wipes alcohol off his face)Scene Six"
Barney," (Phone) Hey loser, how's not playing laser tag? Because playing laser tag is awesome! Oh, I k*lled you Connor; don't make me get your mom!"," Ted, anyone who's single would tell you the same thing. Even the dumbest single person alive, and if you don't believe me...call him.  Hey, listen. I need your opinion on something."
Barney," Okay, meet me at the bar in fifteen minutes-AND SUIT UP![Slides to Bar Scene]"," Hey, listen. I need your opinion on something.  So these guys think I chickened out. What do you think?"
Barney, I can't believe you're still not wearing a SUIT!, So these guys think I chickened out. What do you think?  She didn't even give me the signal.
Barney," What is she goanna-is she goanna bat her eyes at you in Morse code (bats eyes)?? Ted (bats eyes) Kiss me-No, you just kiss her!", She didn't even give me the signal.  Not if you don't get the signal.
Barney, Ee-(Kisses Marshal) Did Marshall give me the signal?," Not if you don't get the signal.  No! (To Lily) I didn't, I swear."
Barney," But see-at least, tonight, I get to sleep knowing, Marshall and Me... never going to happen. You should've kissed her."," No! (To Lily) I didn't, I swear.  Urgh, I should've kissed her. What about when she gets back from Orlando?"
Barney, A week? That's like-a year in hot girl time. She'll forget all about you. Mark my words: you will never see that one again.," Urgh, I should've kissed her. What about when she gets back from Orlando?  There she is..."
Barney," Actually, that is a perfect metaphor. By the way, did I congratulate you two? (Raises glass to Lily and Marshall)"," I never do anything crazy! I'm always waiting for the moment! Planning the moment! Well she's leaving tomorrow this may be the only moment I'm goanna get! I gotta do what that guy couldn't, I gotta take the leap! Okay not a perfect metaphor, for me it's fall in love and get married-for him it's... death.  I'm doing this. (Starts to leave)"
Barney," Alright, but under one condition.","...Barney?  (happy) look at you, you beautiful bastard, you suited up! This is totally going in my blog!"
Barney," (happy) look at you, you beautiful bastard, you suited up! This is totally going in my blog!"," Alright, but under one condition.  (To Ranjit-Cabdriver) Stop the car. Uh-pull over right here. I gotta do something."
Barney, Ted's goanna get it on with a TV reporter (nods. Laughs.) This just in. Okay (holds hand up for high-fives)," (Exhales) Okay. Moment of truth. Wish me luck. (Exhales)  Kiss her, Ted. Kiss her good."
Barney, Why does he get to be the best man? (Shouts out) I'M YOUR BEST FRIEND!," Marshall, remember this night. When you're the best man at our wedding and you give a speech, you're goanna tell this story. (exits cab)  As I walked up to that door a million thoughts raced through my mind. Unfortunately, one particular thought did not."
Barney, You're wearing a suit!, Go back in there!  (from window) Ted?
Barney," So, (looks to the cabdriver) Ranjit... you must've done it with a Lebanese girl.", He's in.  Okay-that's my Barney Limit. (Starts to leave the cab) I'm goanna see if that Bodega has a bathroom. (Leaves)
Barney, The women hot there?," Actually, I'm from Bangladesh.  Here's a picture of my wife! (Shows picture)"
Barney, (Whispers to Marshall) Simple no would have sufficed. (To Ranjit) She's lovely.," Here's a picture of my wife! (Shows picture)  So, Ted. What brings you back to Brooklyn at one in the morning in a-suit."
Barney," So, Marshall. This Olive Theory based on you and Lily?", (Looks up and mouths) Thank you.  Yeah...
Barney," You hate olives? Lily loves them, you can't stand them."," Yeah...  Yeah, hate olives."
Barney," Two weeks ago, Spanish bar on 79th Street, dish of olives-you had some. What up?"," Yeah, hate olives.  (looks around for sign of Lily) You have to swear that this does not leave this cab."
Barney, I swear., (looks around for sign of Lily) You have to swear that this does not leave this cab.  (Cuts into conversation) I swear.
Barney, But you like olives!," On our first date, I ordered a Greek salad; Lily asked if she could have my olives. I said, Sure... I hate olives.  Well, I was eighteen, okay? I was a virgin. Been waiting for my whole life for a pretty girl to want my olives."
Barney," Marshall, I'm going to get you an early wedding present. Don't get married."," Well, I was eighteen, okay? I was a virgin. Been waiting for my whole life for a pretty girl to want my olives.  I think I like your Olive Theory."
Barney, What?, I think I'm in love with you.  What?
Barney," Come on man, you said your stomach's been hurting, right? You know what that is! Hunger. You're hungry for experience. Hungry for something new. Hungry for olives. But you're too scared to do anything about it."," What?  Yeah, I'm scared, okay? But when I think about spending the rest of my life with Lily... committing forever, no other women (Lily appears behind Marshall in the open window) doesn't scare me at all. I'm marrying that girl. (Lily pops her head in from the window. Marshall turns around) Lily. Lily, I like olives."
Barney," Why are we still sitting here? Let's go! We can still make last call. What do you say Lil? (Pirate Accent) Yo, ho ho and a bottle o' rum? (Silence) 'Cuz you're a pirate..."," Olives. Thanks. I love you. What's wrong with me?  Okay, eye patch gone-(takes eye patch off and throws it at Barney) And we can't just abandon Ted. If it doesn't go well up there he's gonna need some support."
Barney, You think they're doing it in front of the dogs?, It's been like twenty minutes. You think they're doin' it?  Doggie style. (Laughs)
Barney, I had this girl in college; she had a golden retriever-," Doggie style. (Laughs)  Okay, we can go to the bar, just stop talking."
Barney, h*t it Ranjit. (They drive off)," Okay, we can go to the bar, just stop talking.  So when you tell this story to your friends, could you avoid the word psycho? I prefer...eccentric."
Barney, There's no such thing as the signal. But yeah-that was the signal., That long lingering handshake-you should've kissed her!  Signal (nods)
Barney," Yeah Ted, we're not on you anymore."," Guys, trust me. I've seen the signal. That was not the signal.  (Toasting) To my fianc'!"
Barney," I suggest we play a little game I like to call, Have you Met Ted?"," Right, so (While Flashbacks take place) back in 2005 when I was twenty-seven, my two best friends got engaged. And it got me thinking, Maybe I should get married. Then I saw... Robin. She was incredible. I just knew I had to meet her. That's where your Uncle Barney came in.  No, no, no-we're not playing Have you Met Ted!"
Barney, (Taps Robin's shoulder) Hi! Have you met Ted? (Leaves)," No, no, no-we're not playing Have you Met Ted!  So I asked her out, and I know this sounds crazy... but after just one date, I was in love with her, which made me say something stupid"
Barney, (hits him) No! As your sponsor I will not let you relapse. You blew it; it's over-move on., I'm in love with her.  I don't know! I just have this feeling. She's the future Mrs. Ted Mosby.
Barney," Yeah, cuz nothing says Casual like inviting a hundred people over just to Mac on one girl. Oh, and Lily-that's my leg.", We are now-Casual  You waited five minutes to tell me that?
Barney, What's so special about the roof?," Get her up to the roof and the roof takes care of the rest.  Oh, the moon, the stars, the shimmering skyline. You can't not fall in love on that roof."
Barney," Solid plan, my little friend.", We do it up there sometimes.  We're the same height.
Barney, But may I suggest one little modification.," We're the same height.  That foxy young thing you were chatting up, take her up to the roof and have sex with her! Crazy monkey-style."
Barney," That foxy young thing you were chatting up, take her up to the roof and have sex with her! Crazy monkey-style.", But may I suggest one little modification.  That's not the plan.
Barney," Should be the plan, I mean look at her. Ted, look at her. She's smokin'!", That's not the plan.  Thank you.
Barney," Exactly! Ted, let's wrap. Statistic, at every New York party there's always a girl who has no idea whose party she's at. She knows no one you know, and you will never see her again. Do you see-where I'm going-hu-with this?"," Yeah, but she's not Robin.  Barney, I don't wanna say-"
Barney," Aargh! (Pulls down imaginary scope) Scoping, beep, scoping, beep!"," Barney, I don't wanna say-  Man you're a dork."
Barney," beep, beep, beep, beep. Target acquired! And now it's time we play a little game I like to call Have You Met Ted?"," Man you're a dork.  No, come on not this."
Barney, (taps woman) Hi! Have you met Ted?," No, come on not this.  No."
Barney, Do you know Marshall? Lily?, Hi.  No. (smiles)
Barney," Hmm, do you know anyone at this party?", No. (smiles)  I work with Carlos.
Barney," Excuse me, (to group) Anyone know a Carlos?", I work with Carlos.  No.
Barney, On a silver platter! Bon appetite!, No.  I don't think so.
Barney," Your loss, her gain. (To Tatiana) Excuse me, can I show you the roof? It's magical up there!", I don't think so.  Sure (Smiles)
Barney," Dude, Robin's not coming."," Whoa-whoa-Hey hey. I got that roof reserved!  Hey, she's goanna show up. (Silence) She'll show up."
Barney," Oh, you were so right about the roof. The roof. The roof is on f*re, Ted! Girl from last night, took her back to my place then this morning took her outside, spun her around a couple of times sent her walking-she will never find her way back and there she is. How did she get here? Did you invite her?", I'm the luckiest girl alive (runs into bedroom. Marshall strips.)Scene Five  I have no idea who that is.
Barney," She said she works with Carlos, who's Carlos?", I have no idea who that is.  I don't know any Carlos.
Barney," Grr. (Turns around) Hi, you. You're back."," I don't know any Carlos.  I sure am (kisses Barney). Come on, sweetie, I need a drink."
Barney, sweetie? Really? (They walk into the kitchen Barney mouths) Sweetie?," I sure am (kisses Barney). Come on, sweetie, I need a drink.  Whoa-Whoa rabbits! Come on, I got that roof reserved."
Barney," So, it's over between me-and-works with Carlos girl."," Alright.  Oh, that was fast."
Barney," Yeah, I was trying to think what's the quickest way to get rid of a girl you just met?"," Oh, that was fast.  I think I'm in love with you."
Barney, I think I'm in love with you.," Yeah, I was trying to think what's the quickest way to get rid of a girl you just met?  What?"
Barney," Thanks, bro (walks away)", What?  (straight-faced) Glad I could help.
Barney," Oh, this is lame.", So I threw a third party for Robin. On a Sunday night (Very Little people in the apartment)  lame or Casual?
Barney, lame., lame or Casual?  Or Casual?
Barney, Of course.," Hello, Barney.  You look well. Isn't it weird they invited both of us?"
Barney, Who? Who invited you? No one even know who you are!," You look well. Isn't it weird they invited both of us?  I understand you're hurt, but, you don't have to be cruel. Carlos was right about you."
Barney, Who is Carlos!?," I understand you're hurt, but, you don't have to be cruel. Carlos was right about you.  Okay, where the hell is my-OHH! (Book has been used as coaster, all wet) Okay, introduction to contract work institution statutes from'65 to'23...is not a coaster! Ted! I'm jeopardizing my law career so that you can throw not one, not two, but three parties for some girl that you just met who's probably not gonna show up. (Ted's shocked) I mean where is she, Ted, huh? Where's Robin? (Finds Robin) Hi! Hi Robin. (Throws book on the floor and grabs Lily for sex)"
Barney, Ohhh.Scene Six," Carlos (shake hands)  She's still talking to Carlos. I can still win this, it's not over."
Barney," Yeah well, the one is heading up to the roof. (Robin leaves to the roof with Carlos)", She's not just one of them she's the one.  What are you gonna do?
Barney," Unbelievable. That is just a recipe for disaster, they work together (Carlos and Tatiana are making out)"," My friends are goanna love you-like you-you know, as a friend. (Robin giggles) Jackass.  You jealous?"
Barney," Oh, please, what does Carlos have that I don't?", You jealous?  a date tonight?
Barney, I'm not sure I like her.," Ohh!!  Hey, don't you have a paper to write?"
Barney," (On Phone) MacLaren's is bore, snore. Ted, tonight we're going to go out. We're going to meet some ladies. It's going to be legendary. Phone-five! (High-fives the phone)", What's wrong with MacLaren's?  I had no idea why I hung out with Barney.
Barney," You didn't phone-five did you? I know when you don't phone-five, Ted. Come on, we always go to MacLaren's."," I had no idea why I hung out with Barney.  Yeah, cause MacLaren's is fun..."
Barney, MacLaren's is this much fun. What I'm offering is the chance to have this much fun.," Yeah, cause MacLaren's is fun...  See, you say that. You say it's going to be this much fun. But most of the time it ends up being this much fun. This much fun is good! It's safe. It's guaranteed!"
Barney," This hand gesture thing doesn't really work on the phone, does it?"," See, you say that. You say it's going to be this much fun. But most of the time it ends up being this much fun. This much fun is good! It's safe. It's guaranteed!  No it doesn't."
Barney, Get in the cab. Marshall you too.," No it doesn't.  Oh, I wish I could... I think Lily and I are just goi..."
Barney, I understand. (To Ted) Get in the cab.," Oh, I wish I could... I think Lily and I are just goi...  Why can Marshall say no?"
Barney, Uhh... because he's getting laid., Why can Marshall say no?  Consistently.
Barney," (Doing I see you hand motion) Ted, Ted, Ted. Right here. You keep going to the same bar, you're in a rut and I am a rut buster. I'm going to bust your rut (Smiles)."," Consistently.  It's not a rut, okay. It's a routine and I like it!"
Barney," Ted, what's the first syllable in rutting (trying to make it sound like routine. Ted gives in and jumps in the cab) Peace out, suckers. (Cab speeds off.)"," It's not a rut, okay. It's a routine and I like it!  Alright, so what's this legendary plan."
Barney, First we got to pick someone up at the airport.," Alright, so what's this legendary plan.  Okay, I'm outta here."
Barney," (To cabdriver) Estaban, doors! (Cab doors lock)"," Okay, I'm outta here.  Just this one little thing and the rest of the night is ours."
Barney, Just this one little thing and the rest of the night is ours.," (To cabdriver) Estaban, doors! (Cab doors lock)  Why do you have those suitcases, and who are we picking up?"
Barney, I don't know. Maybe her? Or her.," Why do you have those suitcases, and who are we picking up?  Wait so when you said you were going to pick someone up at the airport. You meant you were going to pick someone up at the airport."
Barney," (winks) Scenario. Couple of girls fly into town, looking for a fun weekend in NYC when they meet two handsome international business men just back from a lucrative trip to Japan. Sample dialogue, You have a wheelie bag? Wh... I have a wheelie bag!", Wait so when you said you were going to pick someone up at the airport. You meant you were going to pick someone up at the airport.  You've gotta be kidding me.
Barney," False. Sidebar, tuck in your shirt. You look sketchy.", You've gotta be kidding me.  I'm sketchy?
Barney," Trust me, it's going to be legendary."," I'm sketchy?  Don't say legendary, okay? You're too liberal with the word legendary."
Barney, We're building an igloo in Central Park. It's gonna be legendary. Snow suit up!," Don't say legendary, okay? You're too liberal with the word legendary.  Ted, Ted, Ted. Right here! This is happening. Now you can either put your bags on the carousel now, or you can listen to me give you a really long speech convincing you to put the bags on the carousel. Your move. (Silence) Ted, since the dawn of time mankind has struggled... (Ted puts bags on carousel)"
Barney," Ted, Ted, Ted. Right here! This is happening. Now you can either put your bags on the carousel now, or you can listen to me give you a really long speech convincing you to put the bags on the carousel. Your move. (Silence) Ted, since the dawn of time mankind has struggled... (Ted puts bags on carousel)"," We're building an igloo in Central Park. It's gonna be legendary. Snow suit up!  That night, Marshall had a ton of studying to do. So Lily went out with Robin who was new to New York and looking for a friend."
Barney," Okay, carousel four is tapped out. Ready? Because I'm about to drop some knowledge. Cute girls are not from Buffalo. Time-out. Ten o'clock. You ready to rock this, Tedder?"," (To waiting woman) So...uh, did you just get in from Detroit? (Points to self) Japan. (Woman leaves)  Alright, um, I think we need to refine our back-story first. How did we..."
Barney," Ted, you klutzy, great guy, you! (Barney shoves Ted into two lady's cart and Ted trips backwards. To Women) Hey, Barney. (Adjusts tie)"," Alright, um, I think we need to refine our back-story first. How did we...  Oh, my god. (To Ted) Are you okay?"
Barney, Philly? That's where we're headed!, Philadelphia.  You are? Well...uh...guess we'll see you on the plane.
Barney," Yes, you will. (Girls leave. To Ted) Follow them, tickets on me."," You are? Well...uh...guess we'll see you on the plane.  No, Barney. Don't you get on that escalator! And don't you dare get on that subsequent escalator!"
Barney," Hey, is that Marshall? (Takes Phone) Marshall, stop whatever you're doing, get in that hoopty-ass Vierro of yours and come meet us in Philly. It's going to be legendary."," (on Phone) That is awesome.  (on Phone) Man, I wish I could, guys, but..."
Barney," Yeah, yeah, yeah... I sent you some pictures on my phone, check it. (Pictures show Barney doing I see you hang gesture) Philly! (Hangs up. To Ted) Admit it, you're having fun. This much fun. Thirty-five thousand feet of fun!"," (on Phone) Man, I wish I could, guys, but...  Well I didn't think we'd be on a flying to Philadelphia when I woke up this morning, I'll give you that."
Barney, Let's go talk to those girls.," Well I didn't think we'd be on a flying to Philadelphia when I woke up this morning, I'll give you that.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, the seatbelt light is on."
Barney," Ted, you've been living your whole life in a seatbelt. It's time to unclick. (Unclicks)"," Whoa, whoa, whoa, the seatbelt light is on.  (Walks by) Sir, seatbelt light's on."
Barney," (sits back down) Yeah, sorry, sorry."," (Walks by) Sir, seatbelt light's on.  So I grew up in Park Slope."
Barney," (To Ted) No! No! The night is just started. Look, airport bar. Flight attendants! They'll get your tray table at its full upright position. Say what? (Goes for a high five)"," (On Phone) Fine! (Hangs up)  Passengers Mosby and Stinson? Please come with us, gentlemen. Keep your hands where I can see them."
Barney," Don't say you're going to k*ll someone in front of airport security, not cool. (To security) Not cool."," Barney, I am going to k*ll you.  This is an outrage. We are international businessmen on an international business trip. I demand you release us immediately."
Barney, This is an outrage. We are international businessmen on an international business trip. I demand you release us immediately.," Don't say you're going to k*ll someone in front of airport security, not cool. (To security) Not cool.  You demand!? No, no, no, no, no... he does not demand. We... we... we have no demands!"
Barney, (To Ted) Those bags were your responsibility.," We got footage of you placing two bags on JFK carousel three, and abandoning them to purchase a last minute flight with cash.  They were your bags."
Barney, (Stopping him) Please. (Silence) We are international businessmen. My colleague accidentally left the bags there now please let us go before we miss our international business meeting.," Look, this is all just... it's a misunderstanding.  Can't remember the last time I saw an international business man with an untucked shirt. In addition, we received this footage taken over the last few months."
Barney," Believe it or not, that duff bag thing worked."," Can't remember the last time I saw an international business man with an untucked shirt. In addition, we received this footage taken over the last few months.  Truth is, my friend... he does this thing where he goes to airports with fake luggage to pick up girls and we followed some here to Philadelphia. That's it! That's all this is!"
Barney, We are international businessmen...," Yes, he's that lame. Tell them you're that lame!  OH COME ON!"
Barney," Dude, seriously, relax.", Sir! Lower your voice or we'll restrain you.  We at least get to call our lawyer.
Barney, Exactly! (To Ted) We have a lawyer?," We at least get to call our lawyer.  (On Phone) Listen to me, you're both American citizens. Don't let them pull any patriot-act voodoo. You both retain the right to refuse to answer any questions without an attorney present so don't say anything until I get there, alright? Okay, goodbye (Hangs up. Sings) To Philly! The adventure continues! Destroy!"
Barney," Relax, Ted. We didn't do anything wrong. And, B.T.W, we'd be out of here by now if you'd have tucked in your shirt. (Ted turns his head to face away from Barney)"," You had to play the race card.  Go ahead, JFK... what is the baggage status?"
Barney, (To Ted) We're going to Sascha's?," (On Phone) No, we can't just... we're going home!  Who the hell is Sascha?"
Barney, Sascha. (Points to Security Woman) She's having friends over for drinks at her house. It's goanna be legen... wait for it...and I hope you're not lactose intolerant 'cuz the second half of that word is... dairy., Who the hell is Sascha?  No.
Barney, Legendary!," No.  (On Phone) Legendary, that sounds awesome!"
Barney," (On Phone) Marshall, we're going to Sascha's!"," (On Phone. Sighs) Fine. (Beep) Hold on I have another call. (Presses button) Hello.  No, we're not."
Barney," (On Phone) Ted, Ted, Ted. (Does I'm watching you hand gesture) Yes, we are."," No, we're not.  (On Phone With Ted) Sorry, Buddy, two against one. (hangs up)"
Barney," So, uh... you're Sascha's friends, huh?"," So, Barney and I h*t the town. Philadelphia, PA. Our first and only stop... Sascha's party.  You know it."
Barney, Philly!," (Comes down the stairs with drinks) You guys, keep the volume down. You're goanna wake my grandpa. Who wants hard lemonade? (They all take some)  Shh!"
Barney, (Whispers) Philly!," Shh!  Back at the bar, the girls night out wasn't going as Robin had hoped. (Cell Phone rings)"
Barney," (Laughs) Did you hear that, Ted? Dana works security at the Liberty Bell."," (On Phone) No! Don't interrupt it's awesome. So the rings really off, huh? (Realizing what he's done) It's awesome... Well just tell her I called and... tell her that... she's awesome. (Hangs up. Sings dryly) Really, really awesome. Our relationship is built on mutual trust. (Dryly) I can't breathe!  (Smiling) I do okay."
Barney, Wow it must be really well cornered off over there. You ever go behind the rope and touch it?, (Smiling) I do okay.  Only all the time.
Barney," Ever, like, stick your head inside it?", Only all the time.  Yeah.
Barney, D'you ever lick it?," Yeah.  Nope, I have never licked it."
Barney, Hmm... I bet nobody in history has ever licked the Liberty Bell! If someone were to pull that off I dare say it would be... what's the word?," Nope, I have never licked it.  (Decides he's going to leave) Well, this is my stop."
Barney," Legendary, Ted, LEGENDARY!"," (Decides he's going to leave) Well, this is my stop.  Barney, I'm going to the airport. Sascha, thank you... and uh... tell your grandpa I'm sorry I walked in on him in the bathroom. (Leaves)"
Barney, Could have licked the Liberty Bell., Hey!  We're going to the airport.
Barney," Bong, bong..."," We're going to the airport.  Why do I hang out with you? Why? All I wanted was to have a regular beer, in a regular bar with my regular friends, in my regular city!"
Barney," Ted, Ted... you're not even looking."," Why do I hang out with you? Why? All I wanted was to have a regular beer, in a regular bar with my regular friends, in my regular city!  No, I'm not."
Barney," Look, our forefathers died for the pursuit of happiness, okay. Not for the sit around and wait of happiness. Now if you want, you can go to the same bar, drink the same beer talk to the same people everyday, or you can lick the Liberty Bell! You can grab life by the crack and lick the crap out of it!"," No, I'm not.  That was beautiful, man!"
Barney," Thanks, Leonard. Ted, you're missing out on a valuable life lesson!"," That was beautiful, man!  Look, I don't need you to teach me how to live, okay. I know how to live. If you want to go lick the Liberty Bell just go lick it yourself."
Barney," No, it has to be the two of us."," Look, I don't need you to teach me how to live, okay. I know how to live. If you want to go lick the Liberty Bell just go lick it yourself.  Why? Why do you need me?"
Barney," Because, you're my best friend, alright? You don't have to tell me I'm yours. But the way I see it, we're a team. Without you, I'm just the dynamic uno. You know what, fine. If you wanna go home... then we'll go home.", Why? Why do you need me?  Fine...we'll go lick the Liberty Bell!
Barney," Good, (smiles) 'cuz we're here! (Hops out)"," Fine...we'll go lick the Liberty Bell!  (voice) I had no idea how Barney redirected the cab without me knowing, but we got out, Dana let us in and by god we licked the Liberty Bell. And you know what it tastes like?"
Barney, Booger.," That's the crazy part. I've had this shirt for, like, six years... Until this morning I wasn't into it at all, but now it's like my tastes have changed.  Yes, hello, Barney."
Barney," Not some stupid word, Booger."," Barney's offering me fifty bucks to say some stupid word on a live news report.  But I'm not doing it, I am a journalist."
Barney," What? Journalist? You do the little fluff pieces at the end of the news. Old people, babies, monkeys... that's not journalism, that's just things in a diaper."," But I'm not doing it, I am a journalist.  For your information, my boss is about to bump me up to the City Hall b*at."
Barney," Of course not, because now you're saying Nipple and it's a hundred! (Whispers) Step into my web.", So I'm not going to jeopardize my promotion by saying Booger for fifty bucks.  (Sipping drink) Mmm... Who's bourbon is this?
Barney," Hold up, there are only two reasons to date a girl you've already dated. Breast, Implants."," (Laughs) Not Goonies, girls. What if there's someone from my past, who I thought was wrong for me at the time, but in fact she, like my shirt, is actually a perfect fit?  That's not a bad idea. Let's think, Ted's greatest hits... what about that girl, Steph?"
Barney, You dumped a p*rn star? Friendship over (gets up) FRIENDSHIP OVER!," I just wasn't looking for a big commitment at the time, of course now a big commitment doesn't seem so bad... maybe I should call her? What do you guys think?  Come in, (On Phone) Alright, I'll get back to you. (Hangs up)"
Barney," There she is. Hey is it cold in here, because I can kind of see Robin's nickels? Now for your next challenge..."," At least it's better than booger. (Laughs) Booger.  No, there is not going to be another challenge, I don't care how much you offer me."
Barney," Oh, search your soul, Robin. You and I both know this wasn't about the money. Sure, Metro News One pays you jack and hey, a little green salad on the side's good for you, me and Mr. McGee."," No, there is not going to be another challenge, I don't care how much you offer me.  Seriously, who talks like that?"
Barney," Well baby really likes, is the thrill of pulling one over on those bean counters, who under appreciate you and still haven't promoted you. And for two more hundy-sticks, baby's going to look in the camera and say this (Whispers in her ear)"," Seriously, who talks like that?  Eew. I'm just assuming."
Barney, Did you sleep with her sister?, I don't know!  No.
Barney, Sleep with her mom?, No.  No.
Barney, I'm losing interest in your story.," No.  Well, you must have done something. Why did you guys break up?"
Barney," Know, that was a big mistake, Ted. You should've done it in person."," (On Phone) Hi, Marshall, it's Lily. We're not going have sex for at least a month. But you're awesome. Okay bye-bye. (Hangs up)  Thank you."
Barney, Desperate Please-don't-leave-me sex is amazing.," Thank you.  Okay, it was childish and stupid, I just...I didn't want to see her cry."
Barney, You know what else? My younger sister just got married and I'm about to turn thirty-sex. Fantastic.," That was me then, okay? This is the new old shirt-wearing, sack-having Ted. I'm gonna make this right.  An occasion that was supposed to be joyous suddenly turned tragic when Ethel and Sadie Marsolis, New York's oldest twins, suddenly passed away on this, the eve of their one hundredth birthday. I'm a dirty, dirty girl (Slaps behind). Ow. Reporting live, Robin Scherbatsky, Metro News One."
Barney," You know, that Natalie... she's good times."," I have no idea. Some kind of yoga?  Yeah, she's like the best girl you've dated in years."
Barney," She's probably on the subway by now. You could call her Voice Mail. Beep, dumped. Click. Done!", Ineffable... good word. So when are you going to do it?  I have to do this face-to-face. I just... I don't know what I'm going to say!
Barney," Mm... Mm! Six words! You... look... fat... in... those... jeans..., you're free to go."," No, no. We're going to get you out of this. Okay, how about... It's not you it's me?  Ted, have you considered telling her the truth?"
Barney," Seriously, honey, men are working, here."," Ted, have you considered telling her the truth?  Ted, what is the truth? Why do you want to break up with her?"
Barney," And great TV was had by all. Alright Scherbatsky, new challenge. And this one's big. But so, is the cash reward. For one thousand dollars, you heard me, all you have to do is get up there on the news and do one of these... (does odd dance)", Want to talk mature? I just wrapped up a live newscast by honking my own boobs.  What the hell is that?
Barney," And as you do it, you say this, Elbert Ickey Woods. The bangles were fools to cut you in '91. Your 1521 rushing yards and your 27 touch downs will not be forgotten. So Coach Dave Shullah, screw you and your crappy steakhouse."," The Ickey Shuffle.  Just write it down for me. What do I care, it's not like anyone's watching anyway, right? (Sits down)"
Barney, Ahh! This is it.," (On TV) Well...  Oh, boy, here we go."
Barney," (To everyone in the bar) Everyone, everyone... If I may direct your attention to the television. You're about to see something... amazing."," Oh, boy, here we go.  (on TV) And them, in '72, Mickey Mantle rode my cab for the fourth time."
Barney," Come on, baby... bring it home."," (on TV) And them, in '72, Mickey Mantle rode my cab for the fourth time.  (on TV) But the most exciting moment, that would have to be this one, right now."
Barney," No, Marshall. That was beyond my wildest dreams (Robin's wailing on TV)"," You planned that?  So, if you ever come to Alabama, my mom throws these huge crawfish boils and she's just dying to meet you, by the way."
Barney, But isn't it nice to know that people are watching?," (mimicking) It's in my hair!  Oh, my god. Are you alright?"
Barney," Hey, Ted, you know what always picks me up when I'm down? Other people's misfortune. You missed something so amazing.", I'm bleeding internally.  Please can we please have one person in this whole bar who didn't see it?
Barney, Fine., Please can we please have one person in this whole bar who didn't see it?  Are you okay?
Barney, Okay!? Awesome!!," Because tonight, I am getting us all into Okay.  What's going on, did I just have a stroke?"
Barney," Okay is the name of a club. Yeah, it's supposed to be incredibly exclusive. This friend of mine once waited outside for two hours, he couldn't get in."," What's going on, did I just have a stroke?  A friend of yours named you?"
Barney," No... a friend of mine named, shut up."," A friend of yours named you?  Yeah, well the owner goes to my gym. It turns out that he is a fan of my reporting for Metro News One. So now, I'm on the list for tonight."
Barney," Yeah, he just wants to show you his own VIP if you know what I mean..."," He's even getting me into the VIP room.  Okay, what does VIP stand for in your universe?"
Barney,... I know that the P is penis.," Okay, what does VIP stand for in your universe?  Alright, so you guys are in. Should I invite Marshall and Lily?"
Barney, All the things you do when you know where the next ten thousand lays are coming from.," Ever since then she's been signing him up for book clubs, cooking classes...  So, no. Lily and Marshall will not be doing this."
Barney," Translation, she's ugly, she's ugly, she ugs in the ugly."," Oh, you are gonna love Kelly. She's fun, she's smart, she lives in the moment.  Oh, and she's totally hot."
Barney," So, do you have any other hot single fr..."," Okay, I guess I can take her off your hands for an evening.  No, Kelly works with the news breakers..."
Barney, (enters) And his hair was perfect.," Thank you.  Hey we're wearing the same shirt! Oh, wait no that's just my shirt reflected in yours."
Barney," One of the twenty-four similarities between girls and fish is that they're both attracted to shiny objects. You really never read my blog, do you?"," Hey we're wearing the same shirt! Oh, wait no that's just my shirt reflected in yours.  Alright, Tin-Man. Let's h*t it."
Barney, What the hell happened to these two?," Alright, well, have fun at your little disco, guys.  Marshall and I are just growing up."
Barney," Wow, who knew being committed in a heterosexual relationship could make a guy so gay."," Yeah, it's going to be sweet, too. Like tonight we're tasting all these different wines, pairing them up with these cool gourmet cheeses...  Alright, cool kids are leaving now. Grandma, grandpa... don't wait up."
Barney," My, oh, my there are some ferocious looking cutlets here tonight. Alright, hookup strategy, colon, find a cutlet; lock her in early, grind with her all night till she's mine."," Alright, cool kids are leaving now. Grandma, grandpa... don't wait up.  Do strategies ever work for you?"
Barney, Question is: do these strategies ever not work for me? Either way the answer's about half the time., Do strategies ever work for you?  (Shows up) My bitches! Check this out. (To Doorman) They're with me. (Doorman allows them in)
Barney, You think?," Whoa... this place in lourd!  (Subtitle) Okay, it's a little loud."
Barney," (Subtitle) Okay, it's a little loud.", You think?  (Subtitle) There's Kelly. (Leads them through the crowd)
Barney," (Subtitle) Oh hey, I can't see her face. Is she hot?"," (Subtitle) I'm bailing, see ya.  (Subtitle) Hi."
Barney, Maybe theres...,...any aspirin?  a machine in...
Barney, a machine in..., Maybe theres...  The restroom.
Barney, The restroom.," a machine in...  Now to this day, I don't know what happened in there. But when Marshall came out a few minutes later, (Marshall comes out happy and relieved)"
Barney," Ted, bring your coat, we're leaving."," (Comes out wearing many coats) Barney.  What? What happened to that, uh, cutlet you were grinding with?"
Barney," That was my cousin, Leslie."," What? What happened to that, uh, cutlet you were grinding with?  (laughs) What?!"
Barney," No, no, no... we are not laughing about this, Ted. This is not going to be some funny story that we'll be telling in a couple months. It's not gonna be like, Hey, remember that time when you were grinding with... NO! And you know why? Because, italics, this night did not happen. And you promise me that you will never, ever, ever tell another soul what transpired here tonight. You promise. Promise"," (laughs) What?!  (Laughing) Alright, I promise. Let's get Marshall and go, okay. (Takes coats off. To Coat Check Girl) Hey. Thanks for saving my night. I'll talk to you soon? Umm, hey... tip her, Barney."
Barney," Why, I didn't check a coat. And even if I did, on principle tip jars have become so..."," (Laughing) Alright, I promise. Let's get Marshall and go, okay. (Takes coats off.

Barney, FINE! Just... eh. (Leaves)," Funny story, Barney was grinding with this girl all night...  That's a handy new trick. (They run up to the dance floor)"
Barney, (Subtitle) Eww.," So, Marshall and Lily rediscovered their youth. It was nice, and then it got icky. (Lily and Marshall kiss and she grabs his ass)  (Yelling) I'M REALLY GLAD YOU GUYS CAME OUT TONIGHT."
Barney, THEY PLAYED SOME GOOD SONGS TONIGHT.," I'M SORRY, I JUST ASSUMMED YOU...  --HAD OTHER PLANS. I MEAN LATELY..."
Barney, WHAT?," I KNOW, I KNOW. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE SUDDENLY WE'RE LIVING IN TWO DIFFERENT WORLDS. MAYBE YOU'VE GOT MORE IN COMMON WITH BARNEY.  YOU CRAZY? YOU THINK I LIKE GOING TO THOSE CLUBS? I'D SO MUCH RATHER GO TO YOUR FRUITY LITTLE WINE TASTING."
Barney, WHAT?," PROBLEM IS... YOU CAN'T DO ANY OF THAT COUPLE STUFF UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMEONE TO DO IT WITH. AND THE ONLY WAY I'M GOING TO FIND THAT SOMEONE IS BY GOING OUT DOING STUPID SINGLE STUFF WITH BARNEY.  BUT MAN, WHEN I FIND HER. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME BADASS WINE TASTINGS."
Barney, THAT PLACE MAKES GREAT SALADS!," YOU KNOW, TED, I DON'T SAY THIS NEARLY ENOUGH BUT REALLY..."
Barney," You know what I love about Halloween? It's the one night of the year chicks use to unleash their inner ho-bag. If a girl dresses up as she a witch, she's a slutty witch. If she's a cat, she's a slutty cat. If she's a nurse..."," Tarzan nipple blue.  Wow, we get it."
Barney, She's a slutty nurse.," Wow, we get it.  Robin, what are you doing for Halloween?"
Barney, Married., We're not really ready to go public yet.  How about we go about a Halloween double-date?
Barney, Awww., Well.  What?
Barney, And she called it the Tootsie Roll., And she...  Because it tastes like an alcoholic Tootsie Roll.

Barney, Something went terribly wrong.," Hey, can I please tell this story? So we had this instant connection. She gave me her number, but then something...  Guys! Something went terribly wrong."
Barney," You know, Ted, it's been four years. She could be engaged or married or, God forbid, fat."," Never found her number, never saw her again. But every year they have a Halloween party up on the roof so that's where I'll be.  I don't know, I got a feeling. This could be the year. Halloween is a night of wonder and magic."
Barney," No, no, not again. Not this year. You're going as my wingman. Flight suit up!", It's an elaborate costume.  No thanks. I'm sticking with the hanging chad.
Barney," Oh you're dangerous, Maverick. Your ego's writing check your body can't cash. OK. Here's the plan, and I crap you not. I'm getting us into the Victoria's Secret Halloween party. Trust me, by the end of the night, your chad will not be hanging."," No thanks. I'm sticking with the hanging chad.  We can get rejected by supermodels any night of the year. Tonight, I'm going up to the roof, I'm gonna have a few beers, I'm gonna wait for the Slutty Pumpkin. That's just what I do."
Barney," Hm, (putting up left hand) Victoria's Secret models prancing around in bras and panties, or (putting up right hand) Yale preppies reuniting their stupid a capella group. What's that left hand? Right hand sucks? Word."," We can get rejected by supermodels any night of the year. Tonight, I'm going up to the roof, I'm gonna have a few beers, I'm gonna wait for the Slutty Pumpkin. That's just what I do.  I'm heading up to the roof."
Barney," Well, boys, looks like it's just the three of us. What's that? Self-five? Nice. (high fives himself) We out."," I'm heading up to the roof.  Hey, Chad, how's it hanging?"

Barney, There are six chicks here.," This party sucks. There are seven chicks here.  Relax, the night is young. It's gonna get better."
Barney, What be a pirate's favorite kind of sweater?, (singing) My bonnie lies over the ocean. My bonnie lies over the sea. My bonnie lives over the ocean. Oh bring back my bonnie to me...  Arr-gyle.
Barney, And what be a pirate's favorite fast food restaurant?, Arr-gyle.  Arrr-by's
Barney," Would think it would be Arby's, (talking normal) but actually it's Long John Silver's.", Arrr-by's  Actually I kinda need this hand to eat.
Barney, Hey., Really tasty.EXT. ROOFTOP  Hey.

Barney," Every Halloween, I bring a spare costume in case I strike out with the hottest girl at the party. That way I have a second chance to make a first impression.", In a totally new costume.  What's with the face?
Barney, What's with the face?," Every Halloween, I bring a spare costume in case I strike out with the hottest girl at the party. That way I have a second chance to make a first impression.  It's half you're pathetic, half I have to pee."
Barney, So go to the bathroom.," It's half you're pathetic, half I have to pee.  No, there's a huge line. I don't want to miss the Slutty Pumpkin."
Barney," So pee off the roof. Ooh, Ted, pee off the roof."," No, there's a huge line. I don't want to miss the Slutty Pumpkin.  Whoa, I wouldn't do that if I were you. There's people walking down there."
Barney," Come on, Ted, who are you going to listen to? Me or Mr. Goody-goody over there."," Whoa, I wouldn't do that if I were you. There's people walking down there.  Yeah, whatever. You guys got some weed?"

Barney," Come on, I can't stand to watching my delusional friend waste another precious Halloween. The Slutty Pumpkin is not coming.", Nope.  She might.
Barney, Oy.," She might.  Come on, Barney, this is not about the odds, this is about believing. This girl, she represents something to me, I don't know, hope."
Barney, Wow. I did not understand a word you just said. Lingerie models on a boat!," Come on, Barney, this is not about the odds, this is about believing. This girl, she represents something to me, I don't know, hope. (shrugs)See ya."
Barney," No, see ya.(evil laughs, sparks something in his hands) Ow.",(shrugs)See ya.  Wanna drink the melty part?
Barney," You are such a loser. Come on, I came back for you, Ted. I penguin-suited up to show you the error of your ways. And to score hula girl's number. Check and check."," Uh, excuse me, this is gonna sound crazy, but I met someone up on this roof four years ago and they mixed that cocktail and they loved penguins. By any chance, was that you?

Barney," Come on, Ted, Victoria's Secret party now. Let's go.", Nice.  I'm staying.
Barney, Fine. Fine. (puts his flipper up towards Ted), I'm staying.  What are you doing?
Barney, I'm flippering you off.," What are you doing?  Sweetie, I'm so sorry."
Barney," What the? Haha, joke's on you, I have a cold."," I know, I'm still shaking.  Are you guys OK? Marshall (yelling over to bartender): Another round and back it up for me and Lily."
Barney, Marshall ran away from a cockroach.," But those things coming out of his head, those were antennae  It, it was a mouse."
Barney," Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad. You're a man."," It, it was a mouse.  Ooh, my story's on. Ted, pay attention. Carl, turn it up."

Barney, We're signing up., Yes.  What?
Barney," Ted, these chicks are desperate and hot. That's a perfect cocktail. Shake well, then sleep with.", What?  I'm not going to a matchmaker. That's like giving up. It's the man version of getting a cat.

Barney," Ted, hurry, you gotta help me. My boat is sinking.", Come on.  What?
Barney, My boat is sinking., What?  You have a boat?
Barney," Come on, Ted, this is an incredible opportunity. We'll meet our soulmates, nail 'em and never call them again. (chuckles)"," Your boat is sinking. That was good.  All finished, gentlemen? Congratulations, you have just taken your very first step."
Barney," Gosh, thanks, Ellen. I sure hope this works. I'm so done with the single life, all the games, the meaningless sex."," All finished, gentlemen? Congratulations, you have just taken your very first step.  You deserve more."
Barney," That is so true, Ellen. I really think I'm ready to stop being a me and start being a we."," You deserve more.  Oh, of course you can. That is so..."
Barney," It's kinda hard to talk about with Ted here, but I just want someone who's not afraid to hold me at night when the tears come. Ellen, can you help me find her?"," Oh, of course you can. That is so...  Get out."
Barney, What?," Get out.  I get 15 guys like you every week. Jerks who just want to meet vulnerable women, nail 'em and never call them again."
Barney," Oh my God, people do that."," I get 15 guys like you every week. Jerks who just want to meet vulnerable women, nail 'em and never call them again.  You wanna do this the easy way or the hard way?"
Barney, What's the hard way? Security roughs me up and tosses me out?, You wanna do this the easy way or the hard way?  That's the easy way. The hard way is that I stomp the crap out of you myself.
Barney," OK, Ted, let's go."," That's the easy way. The hard way is that I stomp the crap out of you myself.  Not you, you stay."
Barney, It's pronounced 'Pa-kojj.'," You're cute. You're an architect. Good career and you didn't use an obvious alias on your application like your friend, Jack Package.  Get outta here!"
Barney," Hey, seriously, you have to stop doing that."," OK, it's back and this time we got a good look.  It's bigger now. It's been feeding."
Barney, So did you get a good look at it?," Shh, shh, it's OK, it's over.  Yeah. It has six legs, a hard exoskeleton like a roach..."
Barney, h*t the horizontal ten-legged interspecies cha-cha?, It's some sort of mutant combination of the two. It's as if a cockroach and a mouse...you know...  That's impossible. That simply can't happen.
Barney," Oh, yeah, we do that behind your back. Ted-out: to overthink. Also see Ted-up. Ted-up: to overthink something with disastrous results. Sample sentence: Billy Tedded up when"," Did you just use my name as a verb?  OK, I get it. Don't worry, I'm not gonna ted anything up or out. I'll just give it a few more days."
Barney," Wow, Ted, sounds like you're her perfect woman."," My God, this is incredible. We're like the same person. Sarah O'Brien loves brunch.  And like the majestic seahorse it's hermaphroditic."
Barney, You wanna be her boyfriend. She already has a boyfriend. It's uncanny.," OK, this is getting weird, the similarities go on and on. She hates phonies. I totally hate phonies too. She's a dermatologist. I have skin.  All right, but it wouldn't hurt to check her out, right? See what my 9.6 looks like in person, as, you know, a frame of reference. And if she thinks she can do 11.45% better, who am I to deny her that?"
Barney," Come on, Lily, don't hate the player, hate the game."," Whoa whoa whoa, let's not skip over this. Raise your hand if earlier today you h*t on an engaged woman.  On the night of July 2nd,'47, conditions were clear over Roswell, New Mexico."
Barney, The doctor will see you now.," Ted, hi, this is Dr. O'Brien. About today, listen, I really need to talk to you. Call me, I'll be at the office all day.  What should I do? I should totally go down there, right?"
Barney, (chuckles) Happy ending.," Yeah, an 8.5 guy. Look, if I was marrying the wrong person and the right person was out there and knew it, I'd want that person to come down to my dermatology office and tell me so.  Look, I have to go down there. I don't know what's gonna happen when I get there but I have to give it a sh*t."
Barney," All right, see you later. Happy hunting."," Look, I have to go down there. I don't know what's gonna happen when I get there but I have to give it a sh*t.  Wait, where are you guys going? Don't you want to stay and see the cockamouse."
Barney," Yeah, we're gonna make some crop circles."," Wait, where are you guys going? Don't you want to stay and see the cockamouse.  Oh my God!"
Barney," No, it's like it'll change everything. Oh, Ted, you are so screwed."," Yeah. I mean, you basically live here anyway. It's not like it'll change anything.  What? What are you talking about?"
Barney," Because I look good. Now focus, you and Marshall are roommates. You have an amazing apartment. Marshall and Lily just got engaged"," And why is that girl checking you out?  Yeah, so?"
Barney," So, you're not still gonna be his roommate when he gets married, are you? Someone's going to move out. So who's it gonna be?"," Yeah, so?  Come on, Barney, I'm sure they've talked about who gets the apartment. You talked about who gets the apartment, right?"
Barney," You blew it, dude. Now that Lily's there, it's a whole new dynamic. They're edging you out.", Dammit Past Ted  That's crazy. They're not edging me out. Marshall's my best friend.
Barney," Just keep your eyes open. That's all I'm saying, Ted. Little things are gonna be changing around that apartment."," One of my best friends. He wouldn't do that to me.  Come on, Barney, you're just being paranoid. OK, seriously, what is this girl's deal?"
Barney, Sort of on a date with her.," Come on, Barney, you're just being paranoid. OK, seriously, what is this girl's deal?  What?"
Barney," I found her online. I'm tired of the whole bar scene, the one-night hookups. I'm looking for a soul-mate, someone who I can love and cuddle, or so it says in my profile. (evil laugh) But this girl, she wants the same stuff and it's bumming me out. All right, Ted, call me from the hospital.", What?  All right.
Barney," Well, stay tuned, I'm working on some stuff. But in the meantime, wish me luck."," Oh, Lord, fake emergency? That is lamest, most pathetic cop-out in the book. I expect more from you, Barney.  So, are you gonna talk to Marshall?"
Barney," Hello? Robin: Hi there, sexy."," Ooh, can I do it?  Hello, Aunt Kathy, what's up?"
Barney," Hello, Aunt Kathy, what's up?"," Hello? Robin: Hi there, sexy.  Oh, nothing. Just sitting here, thinking about you, hot stuff."
Barney," An accident? Well, is Uncle Rudy gonna be OK? Robin: Aunt Kathy's got an itch that only you can scratch, big boy."," Oh, nothing. Just sitting here, thinking about you, hot stuff.  Oh God! Why did he think he could build his own helicopter?"
Barney, Oh God! Why did he think he could build his own helicopter?," An accident? Well, is Uncle Rudy gonna be OK? Robin: Aunt Kathy's got an itch that only you can scratch, big boy.  Come on, daddy, break me off a piece of that white chocolate."
Barney," Well, if he needs a transplant, he can have mine. I'll be right there."," Come on, daddy, break me off a piece of that white chocolate.  See you guys later."
Barney, See you guys later.," Well, if he needs a transplant, he can have mine. I'll be right there.  Ah, this'll be nice, the three of us living together. I think it's a good setup."
Barney," Told you. That Lily, she's a shrewd one."," They're edging me out. They're totally edging me out. I didn't' believe it but you're right.  Yeah, she got you a nice new coffeemaker. How dare she!"
Barney," Healthy communication? That's the worst idea ever. Look, you held off their first advance. That's good. Now it's time to counter-strike."," One of your best friends. The point is, maybe it's time for some healthy communication.  Yeah, well, what am I supposed to do?"
Barney," You gotta mark your territory, and I don't mean missing the toilet. You gotta do something big."," Yeah, well, what am I supposed to do?  What, like buy a new sofa?"
Barney, Bigger.," What, like buy a new sofa?  Katie's here. OK, real quick, last night, epiphany! I realized what the world of dating needs. Ready? A lemon law."
Barney," Katie's here. OK, real quick, last night, epiphany! I realized what the world of dating needs. Ready? A lemon law."," Bigger.  A lemon law, like for cars."
Barney," Exactly. From the moment the date begins you have five minutes to decide whether you're going to commit to an entire evening. And if you don't, it's no hard feelings just good night, thanks for playing, see you never. Huh? Huh? The lemon law, it's gonna be a thing, possibly starting right now."," A lemon law, like for cars.  Hi Katie. Barney."
Barney, Hi Katie. Barney.," Exactly. From the moment the date begins you have five minutes to decide whether you're going to commit to an entire evening. And if you don't, it's no hard feelings just good night, thanks for playing, see you never. Huh? Huh? The lemon law, it's gonna be a thing, possibly starting right now.  Hi, it's good to finally meet you."
Barney," Hm, yeah. Katie, you are about to be a part of history."," Hi, it's good to finally meet you.  Tell your friends."
Barney, Tell your friends.," Hm, yeah. Katie, you are about to be a part of history.  It's gonna be a thing.KITCHEN"
Barney, It's gonna be a thing.KITCHEN," Tell your friends.  Man, Ted's been acting weird. He started labeling all his food. He even carved Ted into that block of cheese."
Barney," No, I'm a visionary. Lemon law, it's gonna be a thing!"," You're a jerk.  For the record, your little lemon law is a symbol of everything that's wrong with our no-attention span society."
Barney," No, wrong, lemon law is awesome."," For the record, your little lemon law is a symbol of everything that's wrong with our no-attention span society.  It takes longer than five minutes to really get to know someone. You keep giving up on people so quickly, you're gonna miss out on something great."
Barney," OK, you're on a blind date, sitting across the table is that guy."," It takes longer than five minutes to really get to know someone. You keep giving up on people so quickly, you're gonna miss out on something great.  You really think it'll take more than five minutes to realize there will be no date number two?"
Barney, You really think it'll take more than five minutes to realize there will be no date number two?," OK, you're on a blind date, sitting across the table is that guy.  Yes I do. For all I know, that guy's my soul-mate."
Barney," Bad move, Scherbatsky."," Yes I do. For all I know, that guy's my soul-mate.  Hi, have you met Robin?"
Barney," Hi, have you met Robin?"," Bad move, Scherbatsky.  Hi."
Barney," (laughs) Time's running out, Scherbatsky. Last chance for the lemon law.", Hello.  Leave me alone.
Barney," 4:56, 4:57, 4:58.", Leave me alone.  We're only just getting to know each other.
Barney, Say I'm right and this could all be over. This could be your call from the hospital., We're only just getting to know each other.  Sorry.
Barney," So get this, I was on a date with this girl, Jackie."," They're just patching her up. She's gonna be fine.  What? You said she's fine. So, anyway, I was on date with this girl, Jackie."
Barney," What? You said she's fine. So, anyway, I was on date with this girl, Jackie."," So get this, I was on a date with this girl, Jackie.  Wow, Jackie, you make a really great first impression. I have a feeling that tonight you might end up being Jackie O."
Barney," Wow, Jackie, you make a really great first impression. I have a feeling that tonight you might end up being Jackie O."," What? You said she's fine. So, anyway, I was on date with this girl, Jackie.  Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to lemon law you."
Barney," It's out there, it's a thing. The lemon law is a thing. Damn, I should have called it Barney's law."," Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to lemon law you.  But you're totally..."
Barney, And to the lemon law., Here here. Cheers  Self-clink.
Barney, Self-clink.," And to the lemon law.  And by the way, I bought these glasses. I bought them at Ikea. These are my glasses."
Barney," The Thankstini. A fun and delicious new novelty drink I invented. Cranberry juice, potato vodka and a bouillon cube. Tastes just like a turkey dinner.", Not how much? What.  It's like Thanksgiving in my mouth.
Barney," Thanksgiving in a strip club, who's in? The Lusty Leopard has a surprisingly good Thanksgiving buffet. Plus, they do this thing. Heather dresses up as a pilgrim and Misty dresses up as an Indian, and they share a meal."," No, Barney's got his own Thanksgiving tradition.  Oh, Barney."
Barney," I'm sorry, Native American."," Oh, Barney.  I think I'm gonna go to a homeless shelter, serve food."
Barney, Canceling out Barney.," Yeah, I thought I'd just spend the day giving back, you know, doing some good.  Exactly."
Barney," Excuse me, guys. Coming through."," I know. I'm so psyched we did this. Look at all these people, giving up their Thanksgiving to help their fellow man. These have got to be the best people in New York.  Barney?"
Barney," Well, hi guys.", Barney?  What are you doing here?
Barney," Oh, just the Lord's work.", What are you doing here?  But you're Satan.
Barney," Guys, OK, look, I don't advertise it, but I volunteer here. I think it's important to help the less fortunate. I'm the Angelina Jolie of incredibly hot guys."," But you're Satan.  This is a joke, right? You don't actually volunteer here."
Barney, I'm on it.," Barney, we need you out front. There is a logjam on the stuffing line. Can you show them how it's done?  Wait, so, this is real. Barney does this?"
Barney," That's because I was trained by the best, Kendall."," Every Sunday, all year long. He's our best volunteer  Anyway, uh, we're psyched to be here, Kendall. What do you need us to do?"
Barney," Kendall, they're cool."," Come on, we just wanna help out.  Fine, but I'm not promising anything. Wait here, we'll let you know if we need you."
Barney," OK, well, I better get out there. There's a lot of food to give out. And a lot of smiles."," Fine, but I'm not promising anything. Wait here, we'll let you know if we need you.  Oh, I almost forgot. I know it's early but you are a future Mrs. Ericksen."
Barney," Man, it's amazing out there. I've done so much good today, I've got like a soul boner."," Hey Marvin, you're the dorko, dorko!  Yesterday you said the best feeling on earth was getting your toes sucked. Then you requested a high-five with your foot."
Barney," (laughs) You wanna scoop stuffing your first day out? Hello, NFL, can I be quarterback this Sunday? Dude."," Hey, Barn? What do you say you let us sub in for you, scoop stuffing for a little bit?  OK, I finished the gummy bear layer of the salad. What's next?"
Barney," So, wait, not only have you not done any good for anyone today, you're actually helping someone steal from the homeless. You know, Ted, it's called Thanksgiving, not Thankstaking. Damn."," Lily!  Barney, you need me to sign your time sheet, right?"
Barney," Yeah, Right. Thanks."," Barney, you need me to sign your time sheet, right?  Barney."
Barney," Yeah, what's up?", Barney.  You have a time sheet. No one else has a time sheet.
Barney," Yeah, so."," You have a time sheet. No one else has a time sheet.  All right, let me see that."
Barney, That's my private personal business!," All right, let me see that.  Court-mandated community service."
Barney, That's my private personal business., Court-mandated community service.  I was unfairly punished because the wall belonged to the judge's church.
Barney, I was unfairly punished because the wall belonged to the judge's church., That's my private personal business.  You peed on a church?
Barney, I peed in an alley which happened to have a church which I did not see because I was drunk.," You peed on a church?  Oh, you are evil."
Barney," OK, fine, so a judge is making me do this but I'm still doing it, and kicking ass at it, BTW."," Now, all's right with the world again.  When's the last time either of you did any good? Huh?"
Barney, When's the last time either of you did any good? Huh?," OK, fine, so a judge is making me do this but I'm still doing it, and kicking ass at it, BTW.  Kendall, ah, Kendall, Amanda is stealing Portobello mushrooms from homeless people."
Barney, I can't believe that I told Kendall you guys were cool. I had 40 hours left on my community service and now I've got to spend it spearing trash on a freaking median strip., Apparently you can. And his two non-mushroom-throwing friends.  Volunteer of the year!
Barney, Volunteer of the year!," I can't believe that I told Kendall you guys were cool. I had 40 hours left on my community service and now I've got to spend it spearing trash on a freaking median strip.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, look, if there's anything I can do to make it up to you, just tell me, I'll do it."
Barney," Ted, I'm glad you asked."," I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, look, if there's anything I can do to make it up to you, just tell me, I'll do it.  Surprisingly good."
Barney, Right? I told you so., Surprisingly good.  Public urination. Who gets arrested for public urination?
Barney," OK, Ted, I found a way for you to help someone, to do some good. This is Walter, and Walter is homeless. And Walter would like a lap dance."," You wanna know why I have to work tomorrow? My firm's designing an executive lounge for a tobacco company. In the fight against cancer, I'm on the side of cancer.  Are you joking?"
Barney, I never joke about the sublime art of burlesque entertainment.," Are you joking?  No, Barney, that's insane. Sir, would you like me to buy you a ticket to the buffet."
Barney," Ted, Walter's been to three shelter dinners. You know where he hasn't been? To heaven with Samantha. Look, it's the one chance you've had all day to help someone in need. Now buy this man a lap dance."," No, I'm stuffed. Just a lap dance would be fine.  You said you wanted to see the joy in someone's eyes."
Barney," No, no.", I hope not.  These look kinda like blood.
Barney, That's ridiculous.," OK, I know that you've all dismissed this theory before, but is there any chance that Carl is a vampire?  I'm serious. Think about it. He always wears black, we never see him in the daylight, only after dark."
Barney, You gonna put out?," $1500, Stop rounding up. And it's for third world hunger.  What? There's only one reason he's taking her to this dinner and it's not so little Mutu can get his malaria pills."
Barney, What? There's only one reason he's taking her to this dinner and it's not so little Mutu can get his malaria pills., You gonna put out?  I think my soul just threw up a little bit.
Barney, What? You done? Great. Check out table number four. See that little hottie on the end. She's short but has an ample bosom. I love it. She's like half-boob. Let's go.," OK, first of all, hundred millionaire. And second, she's not the girl of my dreams. We're just friend. Look, it would not be smart if we got together. I mean, I'm looking to settle down. She's looking for...  Yeah, and say what? What's our big opening line?"
Barney, Daddy's home.," Yeah, and say what? What's our big opening line?  Daddy's home?"
Barney, Yeah.," Daddy's home?  You want us to go over there right now and say to those girls, 'daddy's home.' Really think about that, Barney."
Barney," Hm. Yeah, I think it's pretty solid."," You want us to go over there right now and say to those girls, 'daddy's home.' Really think about that, Barney.  OK, think about this, is there even a single item on the menu that has garlic in it?"
Barney," (holding up small yellow piece of paper) Then Daddy wouldn't have gotten this seven-digit Father's Day card from Amy, huh?"," Oh, daddy's back. See, if you'd taken a moment to think about that...  That worked. I hate the world."
Barney," Ted, your problem is all you do is think, think, think. I'm teaching you how to do, do, do.", That worked. I hate the world.  Doo-doo.
Barney, Totally.," Doo-doo.  So, I think a lot. I happen to have a very powerful brain. It can't be helped."
Barney, Oh yes it can.," So, I think a lot. I happen to have a very powerful brain. It can't be helped.  Interesting"
Barney," Ted, I believe you and I met for a reason. It's like the universe was saying, hey, Barney, there's this dude, he's pretty cool but it's your job to make him awesome. Your brain screws you up, Ted. It gets in the way. It happened with Robin, it happened with half-boob. And it's gonna keep on happening until you power down that bucket of neuroses inebriation-style."," Interesting  So, what? You want me to do a sh*t."
Barney, Oh no. I want you to do five sh*ts.," So, what? You want me to do a sh*t.  Oooh, more interesting."
Barney," No, don't think. Do."," Barney, I think you've officially...  Ted, he's right. You overthink. Maybe you should overdrink."
Barney," Drink, drink, drink, drink..."," Ted, he's right. You overthink. Maybe you should overdrink.  Ah, Lily, will you tell these guys how stupid they're being?"
Barney," Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink..."," Guys, you are being immature and moronic and drink, drink, drink  Yes! Drink, drink, drink..."
Barney," Yes! Drink, drink, drink..."," Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink...  Let me tell you something about this brain, OK?"
Barney," Drink! Drink, drink..."," Let me tell you something about this brain, OK?  Even alcohol cannot stop this brain."
Barney," I love it, I love it, I love it."," Even alcohol cannot stop this brain.  Drink, drink, drink..."
Barney," Drink, drink, drink, drink..."," This brain, dear mortals, is no ordinary brain.  This is a superbrain."
Barney, No....Dammit., Oh. (Marshall puts index finger on his nose)  How quickly you all forget. I haven't puked since high school. I am vomit-free since ninety-three. Vomit free since ninety-three. That's funny. I'm funny.
Barney," No, no, that's a great idea. That's the whole point of getting drunk. You do things you would never do in a million years if you were sober."," Oh, bad idea.  Says every girl you've ever slept with."
Barney," Ding, class dismissed. Here you go, kid, you call whoever you want.", You'll get this back at the end of class.  Thank you kind sir. At least someone appreciates the fact that I'm doing and not thinking. And now I don't think I won't not go to the bathroom.
Barney, Hello.," That girl in there is alive, right? Ted: I should call Barney, maybe he knows what happened.  Why are you sleeping in our tub?"
Barney, The porcelain keeps the suit from wrinkling.," Why are you sleeping in our tub?  Wait, were you here when I went to the bathroom in the middle of the night?"
Barney," Don't worry, I slept through it. (laughs) I totally didn't sleep through it. For a little girl, you've got a big t*nk."," Wait, were you here when I went to the bathroom in the middle of the night?  How did you get in here anyway? We put Ted to bed around one."
Barney," Oh, you put Ted to bed all right.", How did you get in here anyway? We put Ted to bed around one.  You guys take care of me. You guys are the best. I love you guys so much.
Barney," Hey, hey hey hey, he rallies. And the night begins now."," I'm back baby doll!  All right, game face on. Carl, two more. All right, all right, what do we think of this one?"
Barney," All right, game face on. Carl, two more. All right, all right, what do we think of this one?"," Hey, hey hey hey, he rallies. And the night begins now.  I think...."
Barney," Ehhh! Trick question, no thinking. You know what time it is? It's do o'clock. Let's ride.", I think....  Bring it.
Barney, Have you met Ted?, Bring it.  Excuse me.
Barney, Excuse me., Have you met Ted?  You're calling Robin.
Barney, You're calling Robin., Excuse me.  I'm calling Robin.
Barney," Ted, as your mentor and spiritual guide, I forbid you from calling her.", I'm calling Robin.  Oh yeah? What you gonna do?
Barney," If you complete that call, I will set your coat on f*re.", Oh yeah? What you gonna do?  You're bluffing.
Barney," Real suede wouldn't have gone up so fast. You got robbed, this is a blend.", You set me on f*re.  You set me on f*re. And who's the girl in my bed?
Barney, There's a girl in your bed., You set me on f*re. And who's the girl in my bed?  And a pineapple. Am I the only one who's curious about the pineapple?
Barney, Who is she?, And a pineapple. Am I the only one who's curious about the pineapple?  I have no idea.
Barney, Nice., I have no idea.  You really don't know who that is?
Barney," No, after I hosed you down with a beverage g*n, I brought you back here.", You really don't know who that is?  I better not have gotten b*rned.
Barney," Sleep it off, bra."," Barney, you've always taken care of me. You are a gentleman and a scholar. Go into my s*ab and take my finest stallion. He's yours, his name is Windjammer.  I'm back, baby doll! Ted: And I am gonna throw up."
Barney," Oh come on. You've gotta give me this one. Those five sh*ts got you farther with Robin than your brain ever did. See what happens when you don't think? You do! More importantly, you do Robin. Come on."," Did you guys?  All right, right over here."
Barney," Someone get him a sh*t, he's thinking again."," Still, what does this mean? Are we dating now? I mean, I never pictured it going down this way, but maybe that's how it had to happen. I mean, think about it...  Maybe it's not such a bad idea to think about this one. You and Robin went down this road before, you got dinged up pretty bad."
Barney, Daddy's home., Wake her up and say what?  Good luck buddy.
Barney, Daddy's home.," I know, it's two years of my life I'm never getting back. A little part of me just wants to jump the bones of the next guy I see.  Or the one after that."
Barney," OK, fair enough. I've got to prove a point to a friend, so you just gave me your number and your name is Amy.", Or the one after that.  Ladies.
Barney, Ladies.," OK, fair enough. I've got to prove a point to a friend, so you just gave me your number and your name is Amy.  I love everyone in this bar."
Barney, Robin., Hey guys.  Hi Robin.
Barney, Top of the morning.," Hi Robin.  Um, sorry I kept calling you like that. I was very drunk."
Barney, I'm good.," I love to snack.  Come on, those calls weren't that weird."
Barney, Question?," Okay, people, let's talk strategy. Last new years, we went our separate ways, and it sucked. This year we party together or not at all. Now, I sifted through your party submission and I narrowed them down to these five.  Yes, Barney, your submissions were received and no, we will not be attending any parties in your pants."
Barney," But you enjoyed the e-vite, right? Thas an actual picture of my pants."," Yes, Barney, your submissions were received and no, we will not be attending any parties in your pants.  Yeah."
Barney," People often ask me Barney, how is it that you're so psyched so much of the time?"," Oh, she works in my office. She seems like she might be into me. She's always finding reasons to hug me. So tonight...  By who? Who asks you that?"
Barney," And the answer is right here... my own, personal get psyched mix. Now, people often think a good mix should rise and fall, but people are wrong. It should be all rise, baby. Now prepare yourselves for an audio journey into the white-hot center of adrenaline. Bam.", By who? Who asks you that?  It's working.
Barney, Let's do this!," Oh, God. I'm reaching dangerous levels of psychage. Must do robot.  Yes! Let's! Oh, driver?"
Barney," Ranjit! Dude, you're driving a limo now. That's awesome."," Yes! Let's! Oh, driver?  I've moved up in the world."
Barney," Hey, what are we waiting for? We got five parties to h*t, and three hours to do it."," Oh, we rode in his cab one time. It's a long story.  Oh, I wish I could come with you guys but Derek should be coming by any minute to pick me up."
Barney, Party number one!," Party number one!  I can't believe we're leaving a party that had pigs in blankets. If you think we can b*at that, you got some brass ones."
Barney, Natalya.," So, Barney, who's your new friend?  Oh, friendly."
Barney, She... Who knows? The former Soviet Republic of Drunk-Off-Her-Ass-Istan?," So, where are you from, Natalya?  Super-drunk-fantastic, huh?"
Barney, Isn't she awesome?," Super-drunk-fantastic, huh?  How are your feet doing, baby?"
Barney," It's true. I can hear them. What's that, little boys? What's that? You wanna go for a... rock?"," Okay, Ted, but these dogs are really barking.  Ranjit! Party number two."
Barney," Oh, wait, wait, wait. We have to turn around. We left Natalya."," Party number three. Yeah.  Barney, none of us really liked her."
Barney, What?!," Barney, none of us really liked her.  Sorry."
Barney," Oh, very nice, Lily. You know, she is a guest in this country. So while you may chose to turn your back on her, I choose to turn my front on her. What up?", Sorry.  I'm sorry about Barney.
Barney, What? She needs to get psyched. Fine.," Oh, dude, not now!  Maybe I should just go home."
Barney, My finger slipped.," Maybe I should just go home.  Look, Robin, you're not going home. Come on, it's New Year's Eve. Look, so your date fell through. So what? What do you need a date for? Someone to kiss at midnight? Fine. I'll kiss you at... a little bit after midnight."
Barney," We couldn't go back for Natalya, a human being, but we do have time for hot dogs?"," Oh, yes. Ted, you rock.  Yeah, we like hot dogs."
Barney," No. No. We are already behind schedule. Ted, come on. We have an hour and a half before midnight I don't want to be kissing Ranjit."," Yeah, we like hot dogs.  You don't know what you're missing."
Barney," Oh, my God. He's coming over. Everybody be cool. Everybody be cool."," Should I say something? I should say something, right? Moby! Hey, Moby!  Hey."
Barney," Big fan. Barney Stinson. So, uh... what about this party?"," Wow. You're friendly.  It's just a New Year's thing. You know, with some friends."
Barney," Yes. Moby... Yeah, it should start high, get higher. This mix is my pride and joy. I never leave home without it."," This is a cool mix. You know, people think a great mix has to rise and fall. I think it should be all rise.  Oh, that's how I feel about Janice here."
Barney, Jan... Aah!," Oh, that's how I feel about Janice here.  So then I say, your motorcycle was like that when I got here."
Barney," But when we said, Hey, Moby, you said, Yeah.", No.  I thought you said Tony.
Barney," No, uh, we're good. We're good. Happy New Year, Not Moby."," You're sure? Come on. It's going to get nuts in there. There's this dude who owes me money.  Oh, hey, hey, um, be safe."
Barney, Why did we think that guy was Moby?," Oh, hey, hey, um, be safe.  I don't know. I see a short bald hipster, my mind goes straight to Moby."
Barney, That's Marshall's phone. Hello.," I don't know. I see a short bald hipster, my mind goes straight to Moby.  Oh, Marshall, thank God I got through."
Barney," Hey, sexy."," Oh, Marshall, thank God I got through.  Barney, where's Marshall?"
Barney, He left his phone in the limo. He's out looking for you.," Barney, where's Marshall?  What? Where?"
Barney, Party number three.," What? Where?  Well, I'm here at party number three and... Oh, my God! Guess who just walked in... Moby!"
Barney, Moby?! She's upstairs.," Well, I'm here at party number three and... Oh, my God! Guess who just walked in... Moby!  Lily, you have to get out of there this instant. That's not Moby."
Barney," Well, we know it's not Moby and it's not Tony."," Who was that guy?!  Ranjit, drive!"
Barney," Well, after that rather unpsyching experience, you know what it's time for? It's time to... what? That's right, re-psych. Re-psy... Where's the...? Oh, my God! Not Moby took my Get Psyched mix!"," No, no, no, no you were at party number four. You must have looked at the list wrong.  Barney, Barney, Barney, it's not worth it! Let it go. We need to get back on schedule."
Barney," Yeah, you know why all the circuits are jammed because everyone's calling their loved ones, everyone around the world. Everyone except Barney. Oh, sure, laugh. Laugh for Barney Stinson. Laugh for the sad clown trapped on his whirling carousel of suits and cigars and bimbos and booze. Round and round it goes. And where's it all heading? Nowhere.", I wish Marshall would call. I guess the circuits are jammed.  Is this just 'cause you lost your Get Psyched mix?
Barney, I'm sorry. Am I not allowed to have a pensive side?," Is this just 'cause you lost your Get Psyched mix?  No. No, not tonight. Not in the limo. We got to stay psyched. Ted went to a lot of trouble to make this an awesome New Year's. (singing...)*sh*t through the heart And you're to blame, darling*"
Barney," The first time I rode in a limo I was five. I was on the way to my grandfather's funeral. I suppose, in a way, I still am."," Oh, she just had to make an appearance at this other party. It's no big deal.  Okay, wow, it's getting weird in here. I'm going to call Marshall."
Barney," Give it a rest, Ted.", Marshall!  Give what a rest?
Barney," Trying to turn this night into anything more than what it is, which is New Year's Eve which is the single biggest letdown of a night every single year.", Give what a rest?  Marshall!
Barney," Stop trying to chase down some magical, perfect New Years, Ted. It doesn't exist."," Come on, come on, we can still turn this thing around. We've still got ten minutes.  Marshall!"
Barney, Come on! Oh! Oh!," Yes, Moby's party. Check it out. He signed my shirt. And guess what I found. Yeah, I heard it playing at the party, so I swiped it. Yeah, I know. Come on.  Baby, baby, I was so worried about you. Why didn't you call me?"
Barney," Yeah, it turns out she was asleep in the front seat the whole time. Ranjit, why didn't you tell me?", Natalya?  I didn't want to awake her. She looked so peaceful.
Barney, Cheers. Well said.," Ranjit, put her in park. Dudes, I'm sure party number five is awesome, but it's not the best party in New York. 'Cause this is, right here.  Cheers."
Barney," Here, you need a mint."," I super love you, okay?  Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Happy New Year!"
Barney," Ted, have you ignored all my teachings? Ted: For the most part, yeah."," Who the hell am I gonna bring to this wedding?  You don't bring a date to a wedding. That's like bringing a deer carcass on a hunting trip. Oh Ted, oh Ted, no, no date."
Barney," You don't bring a date to a wedding. That's like bringing a deer carcass on a hunting trip. Oh Ted, oh Ted, no, no date."," Ted, have you ignored all my teachings? Ted: For the most part, yeah.  Deer carcass, really? That's the metaphor you're going for?"
Barney," Ted, it's a simile."," Deer carcass, really? That's the metaphor you're going for?  Well, it's too late now. If I don't bring a date, a $200 piece of chicken-slash-salmon will go uneaten. I gotta bring someone, but who?"
Barney," Don't b*at yourself up. He'll be fine. I mean, the guy's like a billionaire. He can put his platinum card on a fishing line and reel in 10 chicks hotter than you."," Never really clicked. I felt bad though, he was pretty bummed.  Thanks, I feel a lot better. Think I'll get that drink now."
Barney," What I don't get is, why is Claudia marrying Stuart? She's way hotter than him. How way? Way way."," I need a date to this wedding. Wish me luck  This wedding does sound pretty amazing though. Fancy hotel ballroom, everybody all dressed up."
Barney, What?," Ah, here we go.  We can't get anywhere with our wedding plans because I want it to be fun and Marshall wants it to be lame."
Barney, What up?," A little girl?  OK, I'm just saying, that it's my wedding too and I should have a say in it."
Barney," OK, I'm just saying, that it's my wedding too and I should have a say in it."," What up?  Yes, but I'm the bride so I win."
Barney," Seriously, Claudia and Stuart?! I mean, I've hooked up with the odd lass who was beneath my level of attractiveness, but, you know, I was drunk. There's no way Claudia has been drunk for three years."," Right. But I'm the bride, so I win.  You know, I've always found that the best way to get over a failed relationship is to celebrate someone else's successful one."
Barney," Invigorating, thanks."," Yeah, how was that manicure yesterday?  OK, I wasn't going to say it in front of the guys but back then I really thought that's how it worked."
Barney," But to be fair, she's also hot."," I don't believe this, Claudia is crazy.  I totally checked 'plus one', I'm sure I did."
Barney," Yeah, right."," I totally checked 'plus one', I'm sure I did.  I did."
Barney," Yeah, I don't think you did. You know why? Because deep down, you didn't want to show up at this thing with a date. See, for all your big talk about being ready for a relationship, deep down you're single. It's your default setting. Ted, you know what's in the back of your brain?"," I did.  Oh great, here comes the 'little Barney' speech."
Barney," Behind a curtain, in a dark little room, secretly controlling your every move..."," Oh great, here comes the 'little Barney' speech.  A little Barney."
Barney," A little Barney. And you know what he said? (changing tone of voice) Ted, you will bring no dates to this wedding. You will h*t on drunk bridesmaids with actual-size Barney.", A little Barney.  Wow.
Barney," Hi, sad-eyes. What's got you down? Claudia: Stuart and I just broke up."," Let's say we get these crazy kids back together.  Oh, God, I'm so sorry. That's just, that's just... (to bartender) two vodka cranberries."
Barney," Oh, God, I'm so sorry. That's just, that's just... (to bartender) two vodka cranberries."," Hi, sad-eyes. What's got you down? Claudia: Stuart and I just broke up.  You remembered I drink vodka cranberries."
Barney," Remember? When it comes to you, how could I forget?", You remembered I drink vodka cranberries.  (to bartender) They all drink vodka cranberries.
Barney, (to bartender) They all drink vodka cranberries.," Remember? When it comes to you, how could I forget?  So, is there anything else you need, sweetie?"
Barney," So, is there anything else you need, sweetie?"," (to bartender) They all drink vodka cranberries.  You got $400,000?"
Barney," No, but I do have a hug."," You got $400,000?  (looking up, whispers) Thank you."
Barney," (looking up, whispers) Thank you."," No, but I do have a hug.  Stuart, I don't know what to say. If I caused this in any way..."
Barney," Maybe we got together too young. Maybe that's what the problem was. I mean, I'm 28 years old. I've really only been with one man."," You know I don't have $400,000, right?  That's just, that's... (yelling over to bartender) two more vodka cranberries please."
Barney," That's just, that's... (yelling over to bartender) two more vodka cranberries please."," Maybe we got together too young. Maybe that's what the problem was. I mean, I'm 28 years old. I've really only been with one man.  Claudia, it's all gonna be OK."
Barney," Claudia, it's all gonna be OK."," That's just, that's... (yelling over to bartender) two more vodka cranberries please.  Thanks for listening, Barney. Really means a lot to me."
Barney," Isn't it weird that we should run into each other like this? Two souls of equal levels of attractiveness, both fitting together like two pieces of a very attractive puzzle."," Thanks for listening, Barney. Really means a lot to me.  Oh, hell no."
Barney, Oww," Oh, hell no.  Claudia is getting married tomorrow and so help me God, if I catch you even so much as breathing the same air as her, I will take those peanuts you try to pass off as testicles and I will squeeze them so hard your eyes pop out and then I'll feed them to you like grapes."
Barney," Wait, my eyes or my testicles? Lily: One of each."," Claudia is getting married tomorrow and so help me God, if I catch you even so much as breathing the same air as her, I will take those peanuts you try to pass off as testicles and I will squeeze them so hard your eyes pop out and then I'll feed them to you like grapes.  All right, all right."
Barney," All right, all right."," Wait, my eyes or my testicles? Lily: One of each.  Claudia."
Barney," Man, you know something, Stuart's my new hero. If that dude can bag a nine, I gotta be able to bag like a sixteen."," Coming up, are there snakes living in your walls? The answer may surprise you, after the break.  What's a sixteen?"
Barney, Those two eight's right over there. Yeah., What's a sixteen?  Hi Ted.
Barney," Speaking of easy, bridesmaids, Ted. Bridesmaids."," Look at that. That's how it's supposed to be, that, right there. Easy. Simple. It's just not like that with Robin. It's not easy, and on some level, it has to just be easy.  By the way, I almost forgot. We found this."
Barney, Being single's the best., I'm single. Maybe that's just who I am. And you know what? I like being single.  Stay out as late as you want.
Barney, Answer to no one., Stay out as late as you want.  The whole world full of endless possibilities.
Barney, Never having to go to a farmer's market.," The whole world full of endless possibilities.  OK, ah, doing some math here. Table six has got three bridesmaids, an eight, an eight and a seven. I am willing to give you one of the eight's, lowering myself to a fifteen, which means you owe me..."
Barney," OK, ah, doing some math here. Table six has got three bridesmaids, an eight, an eight and a seven. I am willing to give you one of the eight's, lowering myself to a fifteen, which means you owe me..."," Never having to go to a farmer's market.  So there we were, two single guys doing our usual single guy thing. For whatever reason, I had let myself believe that this night would be a turning point, that this was the night that my life, my real life, would finally begin. Funny thing is, I wasn't totally wrong."
Barney," Yeah, I ship out tomorrow for two years. You know, some people say the Peace Corps is the most noble thing a person can do. To those people, I say, Is it? And usually they say, yes it is."," Wow, the Peace Corps?  Barney, they are so right. I wish there was something I could do."
Barney," Oh, Tanya, I'm so glad you said that."," Barney, they are so right. I wish there was something I could do.  This wasn't how I thought the night would turn out."
Barney," Ted, Ted, Ted, look, I got a bridesmaid, Ted, look, look, Ted, the second hottest bridesmaid, Ted, look. See ya Ted."," Wow, this is kind of exciting. Our names will forever be shrouded...  So, I'm Ted."
Barney," This better be good, I'm about to enter nirvana. By the way, I should give you Nirvana's phone number, she gives a great massage. Say what?", Great. How do we get in touch with the bridesmaids?  Barney.
Barney, Ow. I know the house rules. Es un chiste.," Barney.  Uh, listen, Barney, I saw you talking to that bridesmaid last night. Did you happen to get her phone number?"
Barney, You know I did.," Uh, listen, Barney, I saw you talking to that bridesmaid last night. Did you happen to get her phone number?  Great. I'm gonna need you to call her for me."
Barney, You know I won't., Great. I'm gonna need you to call her for me.  Why not?
Barney," Because we just hooked up last night. I can't call the girl the next day. I have to wait at least, like, forever. Oh snap. Never gonna call her. Besides, she thinks I'm on my way to India."," Why not?  Oh, come on, Barney. It's for a good cause."
Barney," Ted going all castrati over another girl is exactly not a good cause. Sorry, buddy, I wish I could help you, my hands are tied. Oh no, wait, that was last night."," Oh, come on, Barney. It's for a good cause.  OK, Barney, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. You make this call and I will go with you to Foxy Boxing."
Barney, Really? Ted: Yeah.," OK, Barney, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. You make this call and I will go with you to Foxy Boxing.  But you always said that Foxy Boxing girls were neither foxy nor good at boxing."
Barney, But you always said that Foxy Boxing girls were neither foxy nor good at boxing., Really? Ted: Yeah.  I'm ready to be proven wrong.
Barney, Tonight? Ted: Tonight. Dial.," I'm ready to be proven wrong.  (on phone) Yeah, Tanya, turns out I don't leave for the Peace Corps until tomorrow. Yeah, I know, sucks. Just one fewer day I get to help people. Anyway, this girl, any idea who she was? Hold on."
Barney," (on phone) Yeah, Tanya, turns out I don't leave for the Peace Corps until tomorrow. Yeah, I know, sucks. Just one fewer day I get to help people. Anyway, this girl, any idea who she was? Hold on.", Tonight? Ted: Tonight. Dial.  (to Ted) What kind of shoes...

Barney," (on phone) Tanya, he's a dude. He's not gonna know what kind of shoes she was wearing.", (to Ted) What kind of shoes...  Actually.
Barney, Oh come on., Actually.  Hey.
Barney, (on phone) Apparently she was wearing brown shoes with little snowflakes on them.," Whoa. There she goes.  Sorry, Ted, I won't be able to make foxy boxing tonight."
Barney," Sorry, Ted, I won't be able to make foxy boxing tonight.", (on phone) Apparently she was wearing brown shoes with little snowflakes on them.  I understand.
Barney," And here's the most amazing part. Because I told her I converted all my money to India dollars, she gave me fifty bucks to take a cab to the airport. That's right, I just got paid for sex.", I have no idea.  I really should give this money to the Peace Corps. They've done so much for me lately.
Barney, I really should give this money to the Peace Corps. They've done so much for me lately.," And here's the most amazing part. Because I told her I converted all my money to India dollars, she gave me fifty bucks to take a cab to the airport. That's right, I just got paid for sex.  Hi, guys,"
Barney," Ted, oh my gosh, I love this moment. You know why? Because I'm gonna say it and this time you're actually gonna say yes. You ready? You ready to say yes? Ted, suit up!", Going. Getting.  Yes! No.
Barney, Oh come on!, Yes! No.  Whoa. Guess we were gone a while.
Barney," Ted, you still with us?"," Good luck, dude. Grab me a cupcake.  Tell me your last name."
Barney," The meter's running, dude. Crap or get off the pot."," And to our dying day, we will remember everything about that night as perfect. Maybe we both need that. So many things go wrong in life, but this is the one thing that never will. It'll always, always be pure, unadulterated awesome. If I walk in there, I'm robbing both of us of what could be...  OK."
Barney,"...Dary! Legendary! Dude, I am so excited that you're single again. We're going to conquer New York City. I already have a girl from work lined up for you. Right boob bigger than the left boob, which some choose to look at as bra half empty. I choose to look at as bra half full."," Kids, there's more than one story of how I met your mother. (Cut to a yellow umbrella floating down a street) You know the short version, the thing with your mom's yellow umbrella. But there's a bigger story. The story of how I became who I had to become before I could meet her. And that story begins here.  I dont' know... Robin and I broke up two weeks ago. I'm... I'm not ready."
Barney, When will you be ready?," I dont' know... Robin and I broke up two weeks ago. I'm... I'm not ready.  It was a good question. (Flashback of Robin and Ted hugging after breaking up) After a big relationship ends, you need some time to recuperate. Robin took a trip to Argentina, and I went through my usual routine. (End Flashback)"
Barney," Ted Mosby, suit up, 'cause here's the plan. There's a Miss Nassau County pageant. We'll pretend to be judges and, yes, our votes are for sale.", I grew my breakup beard.  I'm not ready.
Barney, Finish line of a woman 10K. Salty girls on an endorphin high who just want to lie down. Yeah., I repainted the apartment.  I'm not ready.
Barney, Female acrobats from Montreal. Super flexible. We're going to get Cirque de So-Laid. What up?," And the truth is, I was doing really good.  Barney, come on, we've covered this."
Barney," Of course it's a competition, Lil. How else do you explain... what's his name?", That's my wife.  Gael.
Barney, Kyle?, Gael.  Gael.
Barney," That's a great point, Persian nightclub owner."," (With only a mustache now) What a jerk? I don't go to your stupid country and try to seduce woman with my sexy accent.  And, oh, he is a masseuse."
Barney," How? How would one do that exactly? Seriously, don't giggle. Tell me.", Career? Such an American idea. My career is living. Windsurfing. Making love. Sometimes at the same time.  Not possible. You cannot have sex on a windsurfing board.
Barney, Not possible. You cannot have sex on a windsurfing board.," How? How would one do that exactly? Seriously, don't giggle. Tell me.  How do you know?"
Barney," Glad you asked Lily. I have crafted a list of every vehicle land-based, aquatic and airborne in which/on which it's possible to have sex. And of those 33 vehicles, I have had sex in/on 31. Windsurfing board, not on the list, not possible. Oh, P.S., in order to h*t 33, all I need is bobsled and the Apollo 11 space capsule."," How do you know?  To get that last one, you'd have to break into the Smithsonian."
Barney, This conversation never happened.," To get that last one, you'd have to break into the Smithsonian.  All right, you're suit up, I bearded down. Let's get out there and win this thing."
Barney, Yes!," All right, you're suit up, I bearded down. Let's get out there and win this thing.  You guys, have fun of your duble date."
Barney," Hum-hum. Not for long. Okay, pep talk. Take a knee. Ted, tonight, we're going to get you someone way hotter than Robin. Okay, Robin's a ten. Fine we'll get you a 12. Or, you know... two sixes. Failing that, four threes. And break glass in case of emergency we'll go the Staten Island, I'll get you 12 ones. Ted, my boy, I'm going to re-teach you... Ah."," I just want to make sure you're okay with this? Damn it! I can't believe she's the one that gest to say that. She's winning, isn't she?  Amy."
Barney," Barney. Ted, we are back. Up here. Up high. Fivin' it up five-style!", Ted.  Weird? Why would it be weird? Because you used to date our best friend or because my wife thinks your new boyfriend is incredibly hot?
Barney, Ted. Ted. Ted. Ted. Ted., Damn it! (To Lily) He checks out...  What?!!
Barney," Let's bail, this place is d*ad."," What?!!  Yeah, you're right. We're both totally striking out."
Barney," Yes, exactly, plus, we're on a tight schedule. I've got the entire evening perfectly planned out... Spoiler alert: Our last stop is an after hours club so after hours, it's three days from now. What up?"," Yeah, you're right. We're both totally striking out.  Are you blind? I'm making out with a 12. I am winning."
Barney, Yeah. But I didn't get to help., Are you blind? I'm making out with a 12. I am winning.  So you're saying you want me to throw away a super hot girl just because you didn't help me get her?
Barney, Apology accepted. Let's go., So you're saying you want me to throw away a super hot girl just because you didn't help me get her?  Who's the suit?
Barney," I'm not gonna remember that. Now, if you'll excuse me, random chick from earlier tonight, as you shall henceforth be known. Ted and I have a schedule to keep."," Hum. This is Barney. Barney, Amy.  Oh, well. You can check out off 08:54, dress up like a dork and bother the cool kids. b*at it, nerd."
Barney," Wow. Wow. Great stuff, Tommy Lee. See what you don't understand is, I'm Ted wingman. It's a sacred bond, much stronger that any... They're making out again!"," Oh, well. You can check out off 08:54, dress up like a dork and bother the cool kids. b*at it, nerd.  Massage therapist. And you know what, Gayle? Your piece of chicken looks a little tense to me. Oh, oh, does that feel good, Mr. Chicken? Well, guess what? I didn't wash my hands. Got him."
Barney, They know us here! You're gonna get us in trouble., The night was doing great. Amy was cool and dangerous. She found a friend for Barney. She even paid for drinks... (Amy steals liquor from behind the bar) sort of.  Tell me something. Do you ask your tailor to leave extra room in the crotch for your huge vagina?
Barney," You... your vagina... Ted, this chick is crazy. We're leaving.", Tell me something. Do you ask your tailor to leave extra room in the crotch for your huge vagina?  Good idea. Let's all go back to my place.
Barney," Your place? Thanks, but no thanks,'94 Courtney Love.", Good idea. Let's all go back to my place.  I have a hot tub.
Barney," Okay, this place is actually pretty nice.", I have a hot tub.  I like your tatts.
Barney," Wrong. Ted has a classic clean-cut look that never goes out of style season after season, burn."," Oh, thanks. You should get one.  Yeah? Well. I think he would look hot with some ink."
Barney," No, he wouldn't."," Yeah? Well. I think he would look hot with some ink.  Yes, he would."
Barney," No, he wouldn't."," Yes, he would.  Yuh-huh."
Barney, Nuh-uh., Yuh-huh.  I'm ready to do anything you want by the way. Anything. Right now.
Barney, Ted. Who are you gonna side with on this tattoos thing?, I'm ready to do anything you want by the way. Anything. Right now.  I think I'd look way hot with some ink.
Barney," Unfair? I wouldn't let you take care of the imaginary kids I make up to score with single moms. That's it Ted, we're going home. Ted? Ted, you okay?", Sorry. I used to nanny for those jerks before they fired me. So unfair.  Robin and Gael are windsurfing)
Barney," You're not getting a tattoo. It's not you. Ted, you are heading down a dark path."," I'm okay. In fact, here's how okay I am. I'm gettin' a tattoo.  That dark path is my driveway."
Barney, But you need a plan and you need a wingman!, That dark path is my driveway.  This is so going in my blog!
Barney, This is so going in my blog!, But you need a plan and you need a wingman!  Want to have sex?
Barney, Okay.," Want to have sex?  Oh, f*re. We should start a f*re."
Barney," Hey, guys, what's the big emergency? Oh and B the W: I am never speaking to Ted again."," Way ahead of you.  Hum. Really, never? Not even if, say, butterflies flew out of his ass?"
Barney, What?," Hum. Really, never? Not even if, say, butterflies flew out of his ass?  Hum. Ted? Could you grab me the fondue pot?"
Barney, Ted?, Hum. Hum. What?  Hmm?
Barney, I came here this morning because... I want to apologize.," Hmm?  Apology accepted, Barney. As you can see, I do just fine on my own. I don't need a baby-sitter."
Barney," See. All this time, I thought you need a wingman to fly, but the truth is you... you've got your own wings now."," Apology accepted, Barney. As you can see, I do just fine on my own. I don't need a baby-sitter.  Hmm."
Barney," Since you and Robin split, you've been gestating. Growing in your cocoon. And last night... you burst out of that cocoon..., like a majestic, uh... gosh, what is it that comes out of a cocoon? I was always bad at science.", Hmm.  He's gonna say it.
Barney," Nothing, buddy.", A butterfly? (Everyone laughs) What?  Ow. Why did that hurt so...? Oh my God! (Looks in mirror) I have a tattoo.
Barney," Oh, that's not a tattoo. That, dear boy, is a tramp stamp.", Ow. Why did that hurt so...? Oh my God! (Looks in mirror) I have a tattoo.  Tramp stamp?
Barney," You know, a ho tat. Ass antlers. A Panama City license plate.", Tramp stamp?  And suddenly it all came back to me.
Barney," Oh, yeah, that'll get it out.", No no no no no no no. Give me this.  Maybe you should try club soda.
Barney, Go for Barney.," Kids, I can't remember exactly what helped me get through the whole Robin-Gael incident. I'm sure it was something profound and meaningful and not at all macho and petty. But after that, I was back on my feet. And what followed was a new era in my life. A crazy time unlike anything that came before. (The camera goes outside to show a sea of black umbrellas, and one yellow one walking through the crowd) It's funny looking back on those days, knowing now exactly what I was heading towards, and what was heading towards me.  Hey, man. It's Marshall. Check your e-mail. Sent you something."
Barney, What is it?," Hey, man. It's Marshall. Check your e-mail. Sent you something.  Just a new website. Slapcountdown.com."

Barney," So Victoria, did you ever re-return to this guy?"," Victoria, that was an honest and mature answer. You may advance to The Gumdrop Mountains.  What?"
Barney," Shannon?! Shannon, Shannon... No, don't remember any Shannon."," Oh, Barney, by the way, I went to a party in that new building on 82nd, and the host said she knew you. What is her name? Sharon? Shannon?  Really? Well, 'cause she gave me a videotape to give..."

Barney," Give it to me, give it, give me..."," Yeah, you were acting so weird about it, I gave you Ted's graduation tape instead. So, should we pop it in?  Play the tape, play it, play it!"
Barney," Ted! Fine, fine. You cannot play it. Shannon! I love you! I love you so much. What about us changing the world together? Don't tell me you've forgotten. I know I haven't.

Barney," Hey, guys, what up?"," Yeah, I left two messages. I checked the cigar club, the Lusty Leopard. He's off the grid.  Barney, where have you been?"
Barney," I'm sorry. I don't want to talk about it. It was the most embarrassing, and humiliating thing that ever happened to me."," Come on. Stay!  Well, we all have embarrassing stories. Sometimes it's good to-to talk about it."

Barney," As I walked away, I realized Shannon was an adult. Her father couldn't control her life. I had to go back and confront him. She was in the middle of a heated argument with her dad."," Barney, it's your dream. It's only two years. I know we can make it.  Now we all got to drink."
Barney," I don't know, guys."," Oh, my God. What happened next?  Okay, okay. Marshall's mom sent us cookies..."
Barney," Right. So where was I? Oh, yeah. Shannon was sucking face with her dad."," Barney, that was really embarrassing for both of us. We just earned a huge chunk of story.  How can... With your dad? I mean, I know judge not lest ye be judged, but gross!"
Barney," How can... With your dad? I mean, I know judge not lest ye be judged, but gross!"," Right. So where was I? Oh, yeah. Shannon was sucking face with her dad.  Barney, that's not my dad. His name's Greg. I've been seeing him for a few weeks. I was hoping you'd just leave, and we could avoid all this."
Barney, We're breaking up? But what about the Peace Corps?," Barney, that's not my dad. His name's Greg. I've been seeing him for a few weeks. I was hoping you'd just leave, and we could avoid all this.  Yeah, all this granola business, it was just a phase. Greg's older. He's successful. He buys me all this cool stuff."
Barney, But I love you.," Yeah, all this granola business, it was just a phase. Greg's older. He's successful. He buys me all this cool stuff.  But he has a boat. You should go to the Peace Corps and forget about me."
Barney," I didn't go. That night, I recorded my video and mailed it to Shannon. I didn't see her until a week later. There's sugar in the basket. Shannon! Shannon, you came back!", But he has a boat. You should go to the Peace Corps and forget about me.  I'm just picking up my last paycheck.
Barney, Oh. Did you... did you get my tape?," I'm just picking up my last paycheck.  Oh, she got the tape."
Barney, You? It was you?," Oh, she got the tape.  Will I ever see another rainbow Oh, man."
Barney, The story's not over. I did see Shannon one more time.," Oh, you poor thing.  When?"
Barney," I don't know, I think I might need one last story to get me through it.", You've got to tell us.  Fine. Um... oh! The green testicle story. So I was playing ultimate frisbee in college and there was this barefoot dude with weirdly sharp toenails...
Barney," Oh, come on, Ted! You know what story I want to hear. Everyone else here has manned up tonight and told the truth. Why can't you?"," Fine. Um... oh! The green testicle story. So I was playing ultimate frisbee in college and there was this barefoot dude with weirdly sharp toenails...  You're right. Victoria, I'm sorry I haven't told you this yet, but a while back, I was kind of into Robin. In fact, on our first date, I might have said, I love you. Understandably, she freaked out and I left. But unfortunately, the night did not end there."
Barney, Yes! Do it!," And I drank... a lot. So you guys think I should have kissed her? Well, I'll tell you what, I'm gonna go kiss her right... now.  To the cab."
Barney," Wow, Ted, you were right. You shouldn't have told that story. But you did earn yourself the right to the end of mine. We fast-forward eight years into the future."," Yeah. It kind of is.  Wait, eight years, that's, that's this year."
Barney," Marshall, not only is it this year, it's tonight."," Wait, eight years, that's, that's this year.  Hi."
Barney, Hi.," Marshall, not only is it this year, it's tonight.  Barney?"
Barney," Hi, Shannon.", Barney?  What are you doing here?
Barney," Just listen. When you left me for that guy Greg, it changed me. Now I'm this. I-I know this is crazy. It's just, you were once such a big part of my life. And it just seemed insane that you didn't know who I am now. So here I am. And then she told me about her life."," What are you doing here?  She and Greg dated for a while and then split up. But here's the real kicker: Shannon's a mom. She has a little kid named Max. That's crazy. That could have been my kid. But instead, what do I have? My whole life's some money in the bank, some suits in my closet and a string of one-night stands."
Barney," She and Greg dated for a while and then split up. But here's the real kicker: Shannon's a mom. She has a little kid named Max. That's crazy. That could have been my kid.

Now I'm this. I-I know this is crazy. It's just, you were once such a big part of my life. And it just seemed insane that you didn't know who I am now. So here I am. And then she told me about her life.  Hey. Come on. I mean, just because her life went one way and yours went another, it doesn't make your life any worse."
Barney," My life rocks! Money, suits and sex. These are tears of joy! I could be cooped up in some tiny apartment changing some brat's poopy diapers. But instead, I'm out in the world being awesome 24-7, 365! You let me dodge a b*llet, Big Guy. Plus, here's the mini-cherry on top of the regular cherry on top of the sundae of awesomeness that is my life. After Shannon and I talked, I nailed her."," Hey. Come on. I mean, just because her life went one way and yours went another, it doesn't make your life any worse.  Nope."
Barney, Yeah., Nope.  Nope.
Barney, Yeah.," Nope.  Sorry. Don't buy it. You're making it up. You're just trying to cover the fact that you actually had a profound moment of doubt about yourself and... Oh, my God."
Barney," Video's pretty good on this phone, huh?"," Oh, Barney!  Is your phone on?"
Barney," Oh, no. It just takes a while to power down."," Is your phone on?  Ew, gross. Just stop it."
Barney," Ladies, gentlemen... Ted. This has been a wonderful evening. I got great dirt on all you guys. I got Ted to tell the re-return. I finally nailed Shannon! Told her I'd call her tomorrow. Yeah, right. And I rediscovered just how awesomely awesome my life is. Peace out, hombres!"," Ew, gross. Just stop it.  I think Barney just won game night."
Barney," Um, are you coloring in your butt?"," Yeah, well, things with Victoria were fun, and easy, and uncomplicated. It was pretty great.  I have a big interview coming up, and my suit has holes in it. I can't sew, I don't own Navy boxers, so, yeah, I'm coloring in my butt."
Barney, So wear another one.," I have a big interview coming up, and my suit has holes in it. I can't sew, I don't own Navy boxers, so, yeah, I'm coloring in my butt.  I don't have another one. I'm flat broke. My only other suit options are track or birthday."
Barney," Dude, you show up to an interview in that, even the hippie lawyers from Granola Mountain Earth Pals will hackey sack you straight out the door."," I don't have another one. I'm flat broke. My only other suit options are track or birthday.  Okay, it's the National Resource Defense Council, and it's my dream job. Except it's only an internship, and I won't be getting paid. Mostly getting people coffee. But the people I'm getting coffee for... their bosses are going to save the world."
Barney," Okay, tomorrow... oh, and I should mention this is going to rock your world-- tomorrow I'm taking you to my personal tailor."," Okay, it's the National Resource Defense Council, and it's my dream job. Except it's only an internship, and I won't be getting paid. Mostly getting people coffee. But the people I'm getting coffee for... their bosses are going to save the world.  A tailor? Barney, I make negative $300 a week, and I need every negative penny of that for my wedding."
Barney," Relax, my guy does everything for one third the cost. And there is no way you're getting married in that sarcastic-quotation-marks suit. Tomorrow, noon, my tailor."," A tailor? Barney, I make negative $300 a week, and I need every negative penny of that for my wedding.  No thanks, dude.(Barney grabs Marshall's pants and tears them apart)Noon?"
Barney, Noon. See you then.," No thanks, dude.(Barney grabs Marshall's pants and tears them apart)Noon?  Hey, girls."
Barney," Look, do you want a quality suit and a free rabbit or not? Ted, Sergei says stop moping around. You're distracting him from his process."," Bye. Hey, Barney, I'm not sure about this. A tailor in the back room of a pet store?  You speak Ukrainian?"
Barney, Don't knock long-distance relationships. I really think they can work.," No. No, no, no. No way. You know who likes long distance? Girls. It's all talking and no sex. k*ll me now.  Really? You?"
Barney," Absolutely. I'm juggling four right now. There's Lisa in Madrid, there's Erica in Tokyo, there's Laura in Denmark, and Kelly on 34th Street. The lass thinks I'm a humble sheep shearer from Killarney."," Really? You?  Ted, do you remember in college when Lily did that summer art program in Paris?"
Barney, Are you sure?," Look, she can't be a cat person. I'm a dog person, I'm attracted to other dog people.  All right. (He calls Victoria)"
Barney," Oh, excellent. We'll take this one."," Good to know. Um, okay. Good-bye.(He hungs up)She's a cat person. I don't know this girl at all.  Whoa. Hey, hey, it's my suit. Shouldn't I be the one to choose?"
Barney, Here. Play with this pin cushion.," Whoa. Hey, hey, it's my suit. Shouldn't I be the one to choose?  God. I'm going to look hot."
Barney," Marshall, I can't let you waste a suit this nice fighting a losing battle for our planet's survival. This is a suit for winners. I am getting you an interview at my office. We need good men like you in our legal department. We get sued a lot.", God. I'm going to look hot.  No way. The Kid does not sell out.
Barney," Oh, come on, dude! Three months working with me, you'll make more than Lily makes in a year.", No way. The Kid does not sell out.  No. I've made my decision.
Barney," Look at us: two guys in suits. You feel that slight tingle? That's every girl in the bar wanting you, and every guy wanting to be you. Actually, it's mostly me, but you're getting some of the splash."," Yeah, but only, like, second base.  Hey, babe. Dollar beer night, so I splurged and got us each our own."
Barney," So, have you thought more about coming to work for Barney Corp?"," Hey, babe. Dollar beer night, so I splurged and got us each our own.  Oh, please... your company is not called Barney Corp."
Barney," Yet. Oh, I almost forgot. Sergei sent me your bill."," Oh, please... your company is not called Barney Corp.  B... Barney, this says $4,000. I thought you said that it was one-third price."
Barney," Yeah, must be a $12,000 suit. Oh, well, guess you'll have to come work at my company."," B... Barney, this says $4,000. I thought you said that it was one-third price.  You set this up! You set this whole thing up!"
Barney, I most certainly did...," You set this up! You set this whole thing up!  Well, it won't work. Even if I have to get two extra night jobs, I'll pay your precious tailor. I'm not selling my soul. Baby, I know that this will make things harder, but I will make it work, I promise."
Barney," 9:00 a.m., and you'll need new shoes. Don't worry, I know a guy.", What time is the interview?  I'm glad we got to spent the day doing awesome air kicks.
Barney, Go for Barney.," Marshall was going to work for a big corporation called Altrucel. Altrucel was most well-known for making the yellow fuzzy stuff on the surface of tennis balls. I mean, this was a huge company, so they did other things... But mostly they wanted the public to focus on the yellow fuzzy stuff. Anyway, Marshall managed to score an internship in their legal department because he knew someone who worked there.  Mr. Stinson, this is Willis from lobby security. Sorry to bother you, but we've had reports of a sasquatch loose in the building."
Barney, A sasquatch?," Mr. Stinson, this is Willis from lobby security. Sorry to bother you, but we've had reports of a sasquatch loose in the building.  That's right, sir, a Bigfoot. We don't want to alarm you, but he's been spotted on your floor."
Barney, Yes! Look at you. You suited in an unmistakably upward direction.," That's right, sir, a Bigfoot. We don't want to alarm you, but he's been spotted on your floor.  Whoa. That is a butt-load of motivational posters."
Barney," Yeah, hell, yeah. I got 'em all: Teamwork, Courage, Awesomeness...", Whoa. That is a butt-load of motivational posters.  There's one for awesomeness?
Barney," Yeah, I had it made. Sit."," There's one for awesomeness?  Hey, so, now that I'm working here, are you finally going to tell me exactly what your job is?"
Barney, Please.," Hey, so, now that I'm working here, are you finally going to tell me exactly what your job is?  My dawg!"
Barney," Hey, Blauman, Bilson, this is Marshall. These guys are in legal. You're gonna be working with them.", My dawg!  Marshall Eriksen. Nice to meet you.
Barney, Marshall? Sidebar. Your tie is steak sauce. It means A-1. A-1? Get it? Try to keep up.," Where, I don't, I don't see...  Okay, Eriksen, let's get to work. It's 2:00 a.m. It's raining outside. Ding dong! What? The doorbell? Oh, hello, Jessica Alba in a trench coat and nothing else. But wait-- knock, knock. Somebody's at the back door?"
Barney," What? No. We're having so much fun. You, me, working together. It's great."," I quit.  We're not even working together, Barney. I'm in the legal department and you're... Seriously, what is it that you do?"
Barney, Please.," We're not even working together, Barney. I'm in the legal department and you're... Seriously, what is it that you do?  I'm sorry, dude, this corporate thing, it's just... it's not for me."
Barney," Oh, of course it's not for you. It's for Lily."," I'm sorry, dude, this corporate thing, it's just... it's not for me.  What?"
Barney, Marshall. Lily's a catch. But do you really think you're going to hang onto a girl that great without the package?, What?  The package?
Barney, The package. The house. The car. Sending your kids to a great school. A vacation once in a while., The package?  Lily doesn't care about that stuff.
Barney," Well, no-- now she doesn't, but how's she going to feel in a couple years, when she's supporting you on a kindergarten teacher's salary while you're off in court defending some... endangered... South American... flying beaver.", Lily doesn't care about that stuff.  She'll be happy.
Barney, Okay. But will you be happy knowing you could have made her a lot happier., She'll be happy.  And all four are totally naked. You gotta choose one. What do you do? Go.
Barney," Marshall, consider the penguins."," Barney, how do I get these idiots to leave me alone?  The penguins?"
Barney, On the wall., The penguins?  Conformity. It's the one who's different that gets left out in the cold. This is a motivational poster?
Barney," Look at yourself, Marshall. You're not happy. And you know why? Because you're different. Now, I suppose you could learn to love yourself for the unique little snowflake that you are, or... you could change your entire personality, which is just so much easier.The appartment"," Conformity. It's the one who's different that gets left out in the cold. This is a motivational poster?  Change your personality? That is so awful, and not at all motivational."
Barney," Okay, I'm psyched about this. But if I'm going to mentor you, I need to know you're psyched about this, too."," And so, to fit in with the gorillas, Marshall had to learn to act like a gorilla, and that meant gorilla lessons.  Oh, I am. I'm, I'm psyched."
Barney," Yeah, but it's one thing to say it, it's another thing to show it. Show it."," Oh, I am. I'm, I'm psyched.  I'm psyched!"
Barney," What was that? Marshall, I should feel tremors of psychitude rock my body like a seizure. That was like a declawed pregnant cat on a porch swing idly swatting at a fly on a lazy Sunday afternoon."," I'm psyched!  Wow, that was really specific."
Barney, Show me you're psyched! Let's do this! Ow! That hurt!," Wow, that was really specific.  So badly."
Barney, And then you slip it to the guy with a discreet handshake and he'll get it done., So badly.  Right. Get what done?
Barney, Whatever., Right. Get what done?  Cool. And what guy is this?
Barney, There's always a guy.," Cool. And what guy is this?  Okay, all right, I, uh, I think I'm ready."
Barney, You sure? You want to practice your story one more time?," Okay, all right, I, uh, I think I'm ready.  All right. So dude, check it. I'm in San Diego with two of my bro-sephs from Kappa, and they're all, Yo, Eriksen, let's roll to the strip clubs. So I'm, like, Snapadoo! So we find this choice nudie nest near the airport......and that is when the bouncer kicked us out. Now, I have no idea if Svetlana ever got her green card, but dudes, fake diamond ring? Worth every penny, bruh."
Barney, Nah. I'm so over karaoke.," So, Barney, you gonna sing anything?  Really? I thought you'd be totally into it."
Barney," Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm good. The best, really. But it's the greatest samurai who lets his sword rust in its scabbard."," Really? I thought you'd be totally into it.  Oh, baby, they have our song. Let's do Don't Go Breaking My Heart."
Barney," *He's giving you the blues. You want to graduate, but not in his bed. Here's what you got to do Pick up the phone...*", I'm actually sitting at home waiting for the phone to ring.  Marshall.
Barney," *Done dirt cheap! Dirty deeds. Done dirt cheap! Dirty deeds. Done dirt cheap! Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap, ow. Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap...* Uh, rockupied. Dude, what...?"," I don't know. We struggle so hard to hold onto these things that we know are going to disappear eventually. And that's really noble, but even if you save every rainforest from being turned into a parking lot, well, then where are you going to park your car?  *Don't go breakin' my heart*"
Barney," So, Robin, you ever report on train wrecks? 'Cause I just saw one. What up? Tiny five."," Okay, let's have a big hand for Robin the reporter. All right, our next guest is another friend...  Ha-ha. Laugh now, those kids are monsters. They're going to eat you alive."
Barney," Please. Kids, let's rap. You guys don't give half a brown Crayola what I do for a living, do you?", He has a job doing... What do you do?  No.
Barney, No. I know what you want. Magic., No.  Hello.
Barney," Oh, you mean how Robin's in love with Ted?"," Let me call you back. Honey, there's a situation developing. Do you remember the huge secret that you told me that you weren't supposed to but you did? The thing... about Robin?  What?"
Barney," Yeah, she told me already. Go on.", What?  Wait. So I'm the only one that she didn't tell? She told you and not me?
Barney," Well, I guess I'm just better friends with her than you are."," Wait. So I'm the only one that she didn't tell? She told you and not me?  Well, I'm better friends with Ted than you are."
Barney, That is a lie!," Well, I'm better friends with Ted than you are.  It is not a lie."
Barney," Okay, that's it! You and me! I'm not afraid of you!", It is not a lie.  I'll show you things you never seen before! I used to box in the Army!
Barney, What? No. It's 2:30.," Okay, it's time for bed.  Nothing good ever happens after 2:00 a.m."
Barney," You know, I have found, in my travels... that all the best things in life happen after 2:00 a.m. When I look back at the best stories of my life-- the Liberty Bell incident, the little scrape I got in at the Russian Embassy, the almost four-way.", Nothing good ever happens after 2:00 a.m.  You never had a four-way.
Barney," I said almost. All those things happened after 2:00 a.m. because after 2:00 a.m. is when things get-- audience, say it with me-- legendary.", You never had a four-way.  We're going home.
Barney," What's that? Interesting theory, Barney, but I'll need some proof? Okay. Korean Elvis. How would you like to have a drink with me and my friends?", We're going home.  Rock 'n' roll.
Barney, And it begins.," Rock 'n' roll.  So, um... Hey. I got a new phone. Same as yours. Look."
Barney," Come on, Lily. How many women can say they've been personally serenaded by Korean Elvis?"," Meanwhile, back at the bar, Barney was still trying to prove that good things can happen after 2:00 a.m.  I think he just spat on me."
Barney," No! No, come on."," Barney, you tried, I think that's great, but we're going.  Yes!"
Barney," Dude, we haen't h*t legendary yet. We're only at the le. We still got the gen. The da. The ry."," Yes!  Okay, if we're at the le, then I say we follow it up with a t's go home."
Barney," Trust that impulse, Ted."," I'm sorry, it's just... God, I... I'm crazy about this girl. It feels like maybe... I don't want to say it.  Hey. Something kind of cool just happened. My story on Pickles, the Singing Dog, just got nominated for a Local Area Media Award."
Barney, You lied and said you were broken up with Victoria before you actually were so you could try to nail Robin and you wound up losing both girls in one night?," I'm going to miss Victoria. I should just skip this thing entirely. Robin's still pissed at me after... you know.  Yes, that's what I meant by you know. I haven't seen her in three weeks. She won't return my calls. Look, I shouldn't go."
Barney," Or it's a chance to mess with her head by showing up with someone hotter. Even better, triple thr*at-- hotter and bigger boobs."," You should definitely go. Look, it's a chance to show her you're still friends and that you support her.  That's only two."
Barney, Count again.," That's only two.  Barney, I'm not bringing a date. Even if I wanted to, the thing's in two hours."
Barney, So get an escort.," Barney, I'm not bringing a date. Even if I wanted to, the thing's in two hours.  By escort, you mean prost*tute?"
Barney, Why not?," By escort, you mean prost*tute?  Because... gross?"
Barney," Oh, gross. What, you have some puritanical hang-up about prostitution? Dude, it's the world's oldest profession.", Because... gross?  You really think that's true?
Barney," Oh, yeah. I bet even Cro-Magnons used to give cave hookers, like, an extra fish for putting out."," You really think that's true?  Aha, so then the oldest profession would be fishermen. Kaboom! You've been lawyered."
Barney," Come on, Ted, let's get you a hooker. It'll be fun."," Aha, so then the oldest profession would be fishermen. Kaboom! You've been lawyered.  Okay, to bring to the banquet and hang out with ironically or to actually have sex with?"
Barney, Yes.," Okay, to bring to the banquet and hang out with ironically or to actually have sex with?  No! It's illegal. And did I mention gross?"
Barney," That's adorable. Ted, you're such a hayseed. The companionship business is the growth industry of the 21st century. You do realize that one out of every eight adult women in America is a prost*tute.", No! It's illegal. And did I mention gross?  You just made that up.
Barney, Withdrawn.," You just made that up.  Lawyered. The point is, how long has it been?"
Barney, Is that your water? May I?," 57 days.  Yeah, go ahead."
Barney," Much obliged. 57 days?! Ted, you are in a slump."," Yeah, go ahead.  No, it's not a slump. It's an intentional hiatus from girls. A slump is when you strike out every time you step up to the plate. But I'm off the roster, baby. I'm in the locker room sitting in the whirlpool. And I'll tell you something, it feels pretty good."
Barney," Yeah, you know what else is in that locker room? A naked dudes hanging brain. Ted, you need a lady. And I've got the next best thing-- Mary. She lives in my building. She's smart, she's hot, she's totally cool."," No, it's not a slump. It's an intentional hiatus from girls. A slump is when you strike out every time you step up to the plate. But I'm off the roster, baby. I'm in the locker room sitting in the whirlpool. And I'll tell you something, it feels pretty good.  Oh, she sounds great. And who knows? Maybe we'll wind up getting married someday. You know, if we can get a blessing from her pimp."
Barney, You want to judge a fellow human being based solely on one external characteristic? That's racism. And I do not drink with r*cist. Good day.," Oh, she sounds great. And who knows? Maybe we'll wind up getting married someday. You know, if we can get a blessing from her pimp.  You're just waiting for me to speak, so you can..."
Barney, I said good day!," You're just waiting for me to speak, so you can...  So should I wear my hair up or down? Lily."
Barney," Yeah, it won't be weird."," No, it's fine. Look, in spite of whatever happened between us, Robin and I are still friends. I don't think it'll be weird.  Thank you."
Barney, Because you're going to bring your own date.," Thank you.  Hello, Barney."
Barney," Hi, Mary. Have you met Ted?"," Hello, Barney.  Nice to meet you Ted."
Barney," See you in two shakes, Mare. You two make yourselves comfortable."," Uh, yeah, will you just excuse us for one minute? Barney.  What the hell?"
Barney," Dude, your narrow-minded views on professional fornicators were harshing my mellow. So I got you a date for the evening.", What the hell?  You got me a hooker. A really hot hook-- A hooker!
Barney," Think about it, this is perfect. A: it will make Robin insanely jealous... B: you get to have sex with her... and C: maybe by getting to know Mary, you'll come to see that courtesans are people, too. And D: B all night long.", You got me a hooker. A really hot hook-- A hooker!  I'm not taking a prost*tute to Robin's banquet.
Barney," The only people who will know are you, me and Marshall. No one will suspect a thing. They'll just see you with this unbelievably smoking hot girl and... Okay, that's a little bit suspicious. Look, I'm just trying to expand your horizons a little bit tonight. But if you're not interested, fine, I'm out 500 bucks. Whatever.", I'm not taking a prost*tute to Robin's banquet.  500 bucks?
Barney," Ted, you're my cabron. You think I'm gonna stick you with some toothless tr*nny from the Port Authority? Look at how hot she is. Robin would be so jealous."," 500 bucks?  I'm not trying to make Robin jealous, Barney. Look, I... tell Mary, thanks, but no thanks. I have a soul."
Barney," Oh, please. How's it's going to come out? Uh, pass me a towel. P.S., I have sex for money."," Yeah, I can't believe you let her and Lily go to the ladies' room together, man. Secrets come out in there.  Who has sex for money?"
Barney," Lily, quit your job. Work at a private school. You won't have to deal with the school board, and you'll make a ton more money."," Well, I teach kindergarten and the school board took away my nap time, the kids' nap time.  Well, guess what, Barney? I don't base all my life decisions on how much money I'm going to make, unlike you and, sadly, my fiance."
Barney, She's a paralegal.," So, Mary, what do you do for a living?  Yes, I'm a paralegal."
Barney," Room 1506. My treat. You kids go nuts. Actually, don't use the mini-bar. Do it. Come on, Ted, do it. This is one of those things you have to do before you turn 30.", Yeah? Maybe it's too bad we don't have a room.  Sleep with a prost*tute?
Barney," No, lose your virginity. What up. Statistic-- men who have had at least one relationship with a prost*tute are 75% more likely to have success in future relationships.", Sleep with a prost*tute?  You just made that up.
Barney, Withdrawn.," You just made that up.  Lawyered. Okay, three things. First of all, Robin's category's almost up. And second of all, you cannot do this. It's wrong on every level. And third, I've been placing small items in Sandy's hair all night. He still hasn't noticed."
Barney, So you and he aren't...?, I put him in a cab.  I don't date people I work with. I was just trying to make Ted jealous. Is he...?
Barney," Okay, well, I guess now is as good a time as any. In keeping with tonight's award show motif, I'd like to announce this evening's big twist ending! Vampire Lou, would you do the honors?", No!  Mary's not really a prost*tute.
Barney," That's all, Vampire Lou. Nicely done.", What?  So she's not...?
Barney," No. Mary's just a paralegal who lives in my building. Oh-- ha-ha! And here's the best part-- she has no idea that Ted thinks she's a hooker. Oh, come on. If you don't laugh, it just seems mean.", So she's not...?  I feel kind of like Richard Gere.
Barney," I know, it was hilarious."," Not funny, dude.  Why would you do that?"
Barney, I did it to prove a point., Why would you do that?  What point?
Barney," Stay with me. It's going to come to me. No. Ah, okay, here's the point. You thought that Mary was a sure thing, right? So what happened? She took you up to a hotel room on the first date. All you have to do is be that confident with every girl you meet and your slump is over."," What point?  So the message is, I should treat every woman like a whore?"
Barney," Come on, dude, you should be thanking me."," So the message is, I should treat every woman like a whore?  She slapped me and stormed off."
Barney, Can you blame her? You called her a hooker.," She slapped me and stormed off.  I'm sorry, dude, it was funny."
Barney, Your room?," Yeah. Well, it's getting late. I should get back to my room.  Yeah, that really expensive hotel room you put on your credit card-- never checked out. By the way, you know what's super fun? Pouring Dom Perignon down a bathtub drain. Well, it's almost 3:00. Got a massage. Toodles."
Barney," Hey, what about me? What's my job? What do I get to do?"," Wow. That was really awkward, Lil. And still. It's still really awkward right now.  Okay, your job is very simple. At the wedding, do not sleep with anyone even remotely related to me."
Barney," Lil, you know I can't promise that."," Okay, your job is very simple. At the wedding, do not sleep with anyone even remotely related to me.  Shh! Shh! Look how cute she looks. All tuckered out. Hey, babe. Hey, little one. Hey, Lilypad."
Barney, Guys! I just tasted an amazing caterer., Wow.  We already have a caterer.
Barney," Oh, right. You're getting married. You see what I did there? Took a...", We already have a caterer.  It looks like The 88 are playing at a high school prom in New Jersey tomorrow.
Barney," No sweat, we'll just sneak in.", 'Cause it turns out we're not in high school.  We're not sneaking in to a high school prom.
Barney, Well...," It's nine weeks till the wedding. At this point, I'd say yes to just about anything.  No, Barney."
Barney, Lesbian., Yeah. I never got to go to my prom. We always had field hockey nationals in the spring.  The cough is supposed to cover the lesbian.
Barney," No, I'm trying to start a thing where the cough is separate.", The cough is supposed to cover the lesbian.  Do you think we look young enough to blend in at a high school?
Barney," Please, I'm ageless, Scherbotsky just needs a good night's sleep, and you've got statutory written all over your body."," Do you think we look young enough to blend in at a high school?  Hey, why don't we all go?"
Barney," Wow. Hey, Thelma, Louise, y'all don't drive off no cliffs now, ya hear? Lame! But seriously, leave me a message, and we'll meet up later."," 'Cause, you know, you be a bad, bad man, and I be an outlaw.  All right, what do you think?"
Barney, Horrible.," All right, what do you think?  You're gonna make such a great dad."
Barney," You look so classy and nice. You're going to stick out like a sore thumb. Have you seen how the kids are dressing these days, with the Ashlee and the Lindsay and the Paris? They all dress like strippers. It's go ho or go home."," You're gonna make such a great dad.  Well, we have to get in. I have to see this band, 'cause we have to make a decision by Monday, 'cause I'm getting married in 71 days, and we still don't have..."
Barney," That's the spirit. Now, ladies, slut up!"," All right.  I never thought this would be a bad thing, but my wardrobe just isn't slutty enough."
Barney," Nice. You ladies look good, but your outfits are missing just one thing."," No, baby. We're gonna be an umpire someday.  No, Barney, this is as far as we're going to go. I'm not showing anymore..."
Barney, Two beautiful flowers for two beautiful flowers.," No, Barney, this is as far as we're going to go. I'm not showing anymore...  Aw. Sweet. Thank you."
Barney," Oh, Robin, are you tearing up?"," Aw. Sweet. Thank you.  No. I've never been to prom before, okay?"
Barney," Hey, ho, hey!"," And you're just finding a band?  I'm sorry, ma'am. You either need to be a student or the date of a student."
Barney," It's cool. Time to activate plan B. Scherbotsky, how comfortable are you with a crossbow? Scherbotsky?"," Wow. Ma'am? Check and mate.  Hey, guys. Do you want to take two hot girls to prom?"
Barney, Don't worry about me. I'll get in. Oh... I'll get in.," Oh, hey, wait. How's Barney getting in?  We're in!"
Barney, She's in the bathroom.," Oh, hey. Where's Lily?  Wait here, I should go talk to the band."
Barney, How did you guys get in here?, All right.  We just snuck in the back.
Barney, You just snu... Are you serious? I've been trying to get in here all night. I finally paid a janitor 200 bucks to let me borrow this mascot costume., We just snuck in the back.  But you got in. Slow and steady won the race.
Barney," You guys will thank me for this later, okay? Listen, Don, Ray, can't we all...?", Absolutely not.  Hey!
Barney," And that, my friends, is why you don't get your money's worth when you wear jeans to a strip club."," I'll take what I can get.  So you got to admit, The 88 are rocking our song."
Barney," I have to, it's my birthday present to Ted."," Oh, geez, Barney, don't do this.  You don't have to. Please, it's going to be embarrassing and we're going to have to stop coming here, which will suck... in addition to probably being kind of healthy."
Barney," Ah... Happy birthday, Ted."," Oy, gevalt.  Whoo-hoo!"
Barney," Uh, excuse me, has anyone ever told y... Oh, my God.", Whoo-hoo!  What?
Barney, Oh! Call an ambulance!, What?  What's going on?
Barney," Try not to speak. Here, sit down. Just don't talk, don't talk.", What's going on?  Is she okay?
Barney," I'm serious, call 911.", Is she okay?  What's wrong? What's the matter?
Barney," Shh! Shh! Just don't move. Don't move. Just try... Here, have some water. Water! Here, drink this. Shh! Shh!"," What's wrong? What's the matter?  You know, the more I watch this, the less convinced I am that it's the greatest pickup line of all time."
Barney," Oh, thank God, you're here.", And here come the paramedics.  What is going on?!
Barney, I think there might be some internal bleeding. Probably some fractures. We got to get her to the hospital., What is going on?!  What are you talking about?
Barney, You've had a terrible fall.," What are you talking about?  No, I haven't."
Barney, Really? 'Cause I could swear you fell straight out of heaven. Angel... Give him your number. What? Give him your number. What?," No, I haven't.  Give him your number."
Barney," Come on, guys, you're embarrassing me.", Give him your number.  Give him your number.
Barney, What are you...? Come on. They're not going to stop 'til you give me your number., Give him your number.  All right!
Barney, It works!, All right!  I cannot believe that she gave him her number.
Barney," Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone. It's been fun. It's Wendy the waitress. Tip her well. Thanks a lot, guys. Troilus and Cressida. Neighborhood Playhouse. Check them out, they're good."," Maybe she really does have a brain injury.  I realize why I'm still single. I'm picky. I'm not going to settle. If I'm going to marry someone, she has to be perfect."
Barney, Binoculars. Second pair on my desk.," Hey, Barney, I had some questions about filling out these requisition forms.  I don't have time to be creepy, dude. I have a lot of work to do."
Barney," Just take a look, will ya? Okay, corner office. Top floor. Check out that guy. Name's Clark Butterfield. He works over at Nicholson, Hewitt and West and every morning, he orders a sandwich from the deli downstairs."," I don't have time to be creepy, dude. I have a lot of work to do.  So?"
Barney," So guess what I did to that sandwich? Here, I took a picture.", So?  Oh! Sweet Lord.
Barney, And now I'm e-mailing said picture to him., Oh! Sweet Lord.  Ooh! Duck! That is sick! Why would you do that?
Barney, Who knows? This feud goes so far back I can't remember who fired the first sh*t., Ooh! Duck! That is sick! Why would you do that?  You?
Barney," Totally. Well, look, if you would just... help me fill out these forms, that would be great.", You?  What?
Barney," Butterfield is going to retaliate within the next four hours. That's been his pattern. This is w*r, Eriksen. I need you to clear your schedule, call Lily, tell her you'll be home late.", What?  This is stupid.
Barney," Stu... Come on, man, I didn't recruit you to work here for your lawyering skills. I recruited you to be my executive mischief consultant."," This is stupid.  This is a job for me, Barney. It's a way to make some extra wedding money, and that's it. Now I'm sorry, but I have work to do."
Barney," Tracy, could you come in here, please? Would you please inform Mr. Eriksen that I'm no longer speaking to him."," This is a job for me, Barney. It's a way to make some extra wedding money, and that's it. Now I'm sorry, but I have work to do.  Mr. Eriksen, Mr. Stinson is no longer..."
Barney, Will you taste this latte for me? I think they gave me decaf.," You wanted to see me, so I guess that means we're talking again?  Tastes normal to me."
Barney," That's what I thought, too. Then I got this e-mail from Butterfield."," Tastes normal to me.  Oh, God!"
Barney, It got me as well.," Oh, God!  Well, then why did you have me drink it?!"
Barney, Because now... you're in.," Well, then why did you have me drink it?!  Okay. Don't think I'm overlooking the obvious fact that I should just be mad at you. But Executive Mischief Consultant Marshall Eriksen reporting for duty. Let's make that bastard pay. You think that we should brush our teeth first?"
Barney," Yeah, it's probably a good idea."," Okay. Don't think I'm overlooking the obvious fact that I should just be mad at you. But Executive Mischief Consultant Marshall Eriksen reporting for duty. Let's make that bastard pay. You think that we should brush our teeth first?  So that night I had a blind date with my perfect match. I was so excited, I got there early. But before it even started..."
Barney," Anything, bro."," Forgive you for what?(Lily leaves with he car)Lily. Lily! Hey, Lily, this is Ted, the guy you left stranded by the side of the road. I just wanted to say good luck with the interview, remember to pick up some milk... Oh, and, when I get home, I'm going to k*ll you. And, also, I texted you the same thing.(He calls Barney)Hey, I need a big favor.  I need you to come up to Duchess County and pick me up."
Barney, No., I need you to come up to Duchess County and pick me up.  It's kind of an emergency.
Barney, What are you doing in Duchess County?, It's kind of an emergency.  Apple picking. Can you just get up here?
Barney," I wish I could help, buddy, but I'm stuck here at work. We're kind of swamped.", Apple picking. Can you just get up here?  Is that Ted?
Barney, Yeah. He's stuck in Duchess County., Is that Ted?  Don't you have a big date tonight?
Barney," Hey, check out this one. It actually looks like Butterfield."," Yep. Gotcha! Classic! Gotta go.  You know, over at the NRDC, it's a bunch of really committed people who take their job of saving the earth very, very seriously. Which is great, and everything, but I can't imagine having this much fun over there."
Barney, You thinking about coming to work here full-time?," You know, over at the NRDC, it's a bunch of really committed people who take their job of saving the earth very, very seriously. Which is great, and everything, but I can't imagine having this much fun over there.  Maybe. Don't tell Lily, okay?"
Barney," Thanks, Tracy.", Taking off for the night.  Are you guys planning on punching some holes in that box?
Barney, Of course we are. Were you going to think of that?, Are you guys planning on punching some holes in that box?  No.
Barney, That would have been bad., No.  Horrible.
Barney," Robin again? Ted, the universe clearly does not want you and Robin to be together. Don't piss off the universe. The universe will slap you.", So... what do you think?  But don't you think the universe has more important things to worry about than my dating life?
Barney, That wasn't me. That was the universe.," Look, I realize we've been down this road before, but the fact is, whatever I do, it all keeps coming back to Robin, so... I gotta do this.(Barney slaps him)Ow! What the hell?  The funny thing was, at that very moment, the universe was working on something... a storm."
Barney," I see where this is going. Ted, waiting naked in a girl's bed wearing whipped cream undies does not work... usually. The setting-- Martha's Vineyard,'99. The characters: Yours truly and a raven-haired au pair by the name..."," I am going to make her... a mix CD. No, I'm kidding. I got a plan. Lily, I'm going to need the spare key to Robin's apartment.  Universe. So, this plan you speak of?"
Barney," Nice try, buddy.", Then I guess it's not meant to be.  Look at the bright side. At least you got some closure. She's made her choice and you can finally move on.
Barney," Ted, she is going on that camping trip. Dude, barring some act of God, Robin's gonna be with Sandy this weekend."," I was never going to take it.  Fine. If an act of God is what it takes, then an act of God it is."
Barney, What are you talking about?," Fine. If an act of God is what it takes, then an act of God it is.  I'm gonna make it rain. I can't let Robin go camping with this guy. So how do I keep that from happening? Simple... I make it rain!"
Barney," Ted, do you want me to slap you again? 'Cause I kind of enjoyed it the first time."," I'm gonna make it rain. I can't let Robin go camping with this guy. So how do I keep that from happening? Simple... I make it rain!  Look, I-I might be crazy right now... No, you know what? I am definitely crazy right now, but I have a plan. That girl you used to go out with, Penelope, wasn't she getting her PhD in Native American culture?"
Barney, Yeah.," Look, I-I might be crazy right now... No, you know what? I am definitely crazy right now, but I have a plan. That girl you used to go out with, Penelope, wasn't she getting her PhD in Native American culture?  Are you still in touch with her?"
Barney," Sure. I mean, even though we stopped having sex, we still get together, like, once a month to chat and catch up, and of course I'm not in touch with her!"," Are you still in touch with her?  Well, you're gonna need to get in touch with her. She's gonna teach me how to do a rain dance."
Barney, Did you just say a rain dance?," Well, you're gonna need to get in touch with her. She's gonna teach me how to do a rain dance.  Yes."
Barney, A rain dance., Yes.  Yes.
Barney, A dance to make it rain., Yes.  Yes.(Barney slaps him once again and Ted slaps him back. Barney tries again to slaps Ted but he stops him)We're finding Penelope!
Barney," No, we are not!"," Yes.(Barney slaps him once again and Ted slaps him back. Barney tries again to slaps Ted but he stops him)We're finding Penelope!  Yes, we are!"
Barney," Ted, you're forcing me to be the voice of reason, and it's not a good look for me!"," Yes, we are!  Why the hell should I help you?"
Barney," Come on, I know it didn't work out between us, but we did... have a relationship."," Why the hell should I help you?  We had sex twice in your car, and then you dumped me. How is that a relationship?"
Barney, Twice!," We had sex twice in your car, and then you dumped me. How is that a relationship?  Barney, there is no way..."
Barney, Shh!," Barney, there is no way...  Seriously, come on."
Barney, Hey., Kind of.  You h*t on my mom!
Barney, We weren't exclusive!, You h*t on my mom!  I'm in.
Barney," Wow, it took five sh*ts of tequila to get you in that position.", Okay. Crouch down and bend over a little bit.  I will throw you off this roof.
Barney, There's so much of your mom in you., I will throw you off this roof.  And she's been throwing up ever since.
Barney," Ted, this is funny. Still funny. Still fu... And now it's sad."," Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy birthday, happy, happy, happy, happy, appy, happy birthday, happy, happy...  Hey, Penelope, you sure I'm doing this right?"
Barney," Hey, Ted. Whatcha doing?", Thank you.  A rain dance.
Barney," Dude, that's not a rain dance, that's a fat kid with a bee in his pants."," A rain dance.  Look, I highly doubt the Great Spirit is a stickler for choreography. It's the thought that counts. She's leaving in half an hour."
Barney, These are your awesome years. You're wasting them on this girl. This isn't gonna work!," Look, I highly doubt the Great Spirit is a stickler for choreography. It's the thought that counts. She's leaving in half an hour.  Yeah. I know that."
Barney," Well, then why are you doing this?"," Yeah. I know that.  Because I love her. I love her! I told her that the first night we went out, and here it is, eight months later, and nothing's changed. So yes, I know this isn't gonna work. But it has to work! You hear me, universe? This is Ted Mosby talking! Give me some rain! Come on! Come on! Come on...!"
Barney," Oh, come on!"," Because I love her. I love her! I told her that the first night we went out, and here it is, eight months later, and nothing's changed. So yes, I know this isn't gonna work. But it has to work! You hear me, universe? This is Ted Mosby talking! Give me some rain! Come on! Come on! Come on...!  Pushing the front back into the Tri-State area and giving Manhattan one of its worst storms in over a decade."
Barney, How about that? He did it.," Pushing the front back into the Tri-State area and giving Manhattan one of its worst storms in over a decade.  Robin! Hey, Robin!(Robin opens up her window)Oh, thank God you're here!"
Barney," I didn't get your message until I woke up. Bro, I am so sorry."," Well, she left. And I don't even know if she's coming back.  Thanks."
Barney, I know it must be tough. But are you ready to hear something that will not only make you feel better but will actively excite you?, Thanks.  Sure.
Barney," For the first time ever, the three of us are single at the same time. I've dreamed about this day boys and it's going to be legendary! Together, we will own this city. Any time, a girl wants to get back at her ex-boyfriend, we'll be there. Any time a girl wants to solve her father issues through promiscuity and binge-drinking, we will be there. Any time a bachelorette party drives through the city in a limo sticking their heads out, shouting What's up New York? we will be what is up New York! Gentlemen, we are about to embark on...(While he's speaking, Barney looks at Ted and then at Robin).Oh man, you guys did it, didn't you?!"," Sure.  One thing I learned that summer is that when love is beginning(Ted and Robin are making out)and love is ending(Lily is leaving the apartment, leaving Marshall alone)the first thirty days are remarkably similar.(DAY ONE, Ted and Robin are in bed after they had sex)For one thing, you spend most of the time in bed(Marshall is in his bed groaning // DAY EIGHT, Ted and Robin are at MacLaren's with Barney, kissing and laughing. Barney seems to k*ll himself, miming a g*n in his mouth)Your friends can't stand to listen to you(DAY SIXTEEN, Barney is with Marshall who is crying and says It was a really beautiful song. Barney mimes a rope around his neck).And you never seems to wear pants.(DAY TWENTY-TWO, at the apartment, Robin is going to the bathroom only wearing a T-shirt while Marshall is wallowing on the couch in underpants. Ted, in underpants too, comes out of his room)."
Barney," So he stays home all the time not getting laid? No, see, that's what you do when you have a fianc'e. He should be down here celebrating. He's free. He got that red-head-tumor removed.", Fine. Than I'll just have the leftover  You should write and illustrate children's books.
Barney," You know what Marshall needs to do? He needs to stop being sad. When I get sad, I stop being sad and be awesome instead. True story."," You should write and illustrate children's books.  It's only been a month. He just needs to goat his own pace. Anyway, lily is the one who caused this whole mess."
Barney, Have you tried breast-feeding? Nailed it!," This has to stop! Ted, we just started dating. We agreed we don't wanna move too fast and yet somehow we have a baby. He can't feed himself, he cries a lot, he keeps us up all night...  They were together nine years. It's only been a month and a half. He just needs to go his own pace."
Barney, Mmm. Sunshine.," It is time for some tough love. We need to get him out of that apartment. He needs fresh air. He needs sunshine.  Gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Sunshine!"
Barney," Do you know why you're not over Lily yet? It's 'cause you can still picture her naked. You can't get over a woman until you can no longer picture her boobs. It's a scientific fact. The average male brain can only store a finite number of boob images, or BPEGs and your hard drive's filled to capacity with Lily's."," Barney, I really don't think this is gonna help.  There are a lot of them."
Barney," They won't go away until you overwrite them with images of other women's boobs. Now, this journey may take as many as a million boobs so we begin here tonight my friend. Two at the time. Those count as four."," There are a lot of them.  Yeah, this is fun, right? We're outside, it's a beautiful day. The Indians are winning!"
Barney," So what's your prescription, Dr Oestrogen? Eat H'agen-Dazs and Watch Love actually until your periods sync up?(Ted and Barney laugh)"," See, this is the problem with guys, you don't know how to deal with heartbreak.  Yeah, that's the stuff."
Barney, Those charges are from a month ago.," Because, Robin, they are like fuzzy tube-shaped rats.  Exactly!"
Barney," For new charges, you have to go to her online account. You can see credit card activity from like two hours ago. But... You know... Don't...(Marshall leaves the bar, running).", Exactly!  Why do you talk? Why do you talk?
Barney," He needs her password. Its not like he has her password. Ooh, he has her password. This is... He has her password."," Why do you talk? Why do you talk?  There is a charge from earlier today. The Kellet Hotel, on Fifth. I don't believe this. Lily is back in New-York. (...) I can't believe this. Lily's in New-York? I guess I'd been thinking when she got back she's call me. That's the only reason I've been able to hold it together so far this summer."
Barney, You want me to baby-sit him? 20 bucks. An hour. And money for pizza.," No! You're not calling her. This changes nothing.(To Barney)You, come here.(Barney and Robin follow Ted in the kitchen).While we're away this weekend can you keep an eye on him? Make sure he doesn't call her hotel.  Um yeah. How about you do it for free or every time we hang out you have to watch this.(To Robin)Come here my little baby.(Ted and Robin are making out)"
Barney," OK, I'll do it! Stop being a couple.", Um yeah. How about you do it for free or every time we hang out you have to watch this.(To Robin)Come here my little baby.(Ted and Robin are making out)  Marshall!
Barney, No!," Hello?!(He hangs up)A guy answered. There is... There is a guy in her room. I'm going down there.  Dude, you can't..."
Barney, Bold. Bold to go for the car.," Because you're pathetic! I'm sorry. But right now, you are not Marshall. You are the miserable, whining, shampoo-sniffing ghost of Marshall and frankly, a guy like you doesn't have a sh*t in hell with a girl like Lily. You know who might have a sh*t somewhere down the line? Marshall. The real Marshall. But if you go down there now like this, you'll blow it for him and he's never gonna forgive you. Of course, whatever I say, you just will do the opposite so, have a great weekend, good luck screwing up your life. Come on, Robin... Is it still OK if we borrow the car?  What?"
Barney, Barney.," I'm gonna call Barney, see how they're doing.  Uh, hey. Where are you guys?"
Barney, We're at a fundraiser helping young women raise money for college.," Uh, hey. Where are you guys?  Strip-club. Nice. Is Marshall OK?"
Barney," Yeah, he's here and he's great. Hang on. Marshall, tell Ted... Uh-oh.", Strip-club. Nice. Is Marshall OK?  Already?
Barney, He's gone., What? What uh-oh?  You lost him? I can't believe it! He's gonna go down to that hotel.
Barney," Crap, you're right. OK, here is the plan. Here is the plan. You go down to the hotel and find him. I'll stay here and get a lap dance. Bye Ted!", You lost him? I can't believe it! He's gonna go down to that hotel.  Barney![End of the phone call]
Barney, You just checked out Robin's ass.," See ya.  What? No. I... Barney, I was..."
Barney," Dude, that's awesome! You're finally forgetting about that short redhead."," What? No. I... Barney, I was...  Lily."
Barney," Yes, Lily, thank you. That was gonna drive me crazy all night. Hey, Ted! Marshall's just checked out your girlfriend's ass.", Lily.  I did not Ted...
Barney," This is the moment I've been waiting for. Starting tonight, I'm gonna teach you how to live. Ted, you're out of chance, Marshall's in.", Awesome! You're finally getting better.  Yes!
Barney," Marshall, being a single guy in New York city is like... Pfff... What does everybody like?"," Oh, God!  Candy."
Barney, Yeah! It's like being in a candy store. You just walk right in and grab yourself some Whoppers. Yeah. Is Whoppers the best ones?, Candy.  Mounds.
Barney, Milk Duds., Mounds.  Gobstoppers.
Barney, Um..., Gobstoppers.  This went on for another hour. I'll just skip to the end.
Barney," Nice! Marshall, we're doing this. I am not taking no for an answer.", Dubble Bubbles.  Fine.
Barney, Hi. Have you met Marshall?," Meanwhile, Barney was taking Marshall out to meet women for the first time since he was 17.  Hi."
Barney," I-I-I Hate to interrupt but, uh... Do you like magic?"," Hi. Look how sweaty my hands are! It's weird, right? Uh, sweat. Like this... Smelly water coming out of your skin. It was nice meeting you.  Umm... I guess.(Barney makes a trick, Umm, I guess is writing on his hand).Oh my God! (Barney does it again, Oh my God! appears on his hand)Anyway, Marshall here is awesome. Salad in a bag? His idea!"
Barney," Dude, you were awesome last night. You were charming, you were funny. You were totally working that girl."," Umm... I guess.(Barney makes a trick, Umm, I guess is writing on his hand).Oh my God! (Barney does it again, Oh my God! appears on his hand)Anyway, Marshall here is awesome. Salad in a bag? His idea!  You went home with her!"
Barney," Yes, I did. But she told me that if it wasn't for me you would've had a sh*t with her. So in hypothetical terms, you scored last night! All right! Hypothetical high five! Nice! Tonight, we're gonna go to the bar..."," You went home with her!  Barney, no, I'm not going out with you ever again."
Barney, Come on! I'll teach you all my strategies!," Barney, no, I'm not going out with you ever again.  Oh, really?"
Barney," My favorite, number seven. Create a mystery about yourself. That way, they become so intrigued that they have to hang out with you all night."," Oh, really?  Oh, come on. Does that really work?"
Barney, Maybe it does and maybe it doesn't.," Oh, come on. Does that really work?  Dammit that's intriguing! OK, I'm in."
Barney, Let's review Barney's rules for mating without dating. Lesson two: corollary five.," Well, it happens. I've fallen out of love faster than that before. Sometimes, boom, with no warning whatsoever. One day we're in love, the next day, he's d*ad to me. But we're great! Honey?  Make a beautiful woman feel self-conscious and unattractive and she'll be putty in your hands."
Barney, Excellent. Have you chosen your entr'e?," Make a beautiful woman feel self-conscious and unattractive and she'll be putty in your hands.  I have. A sweet brunette, eight o'clock. Nine o'clock. Ten; thirty. She's walking to the bar."
Barney," Her? Really? No, you're right. Ambition is the enemy of success. OK, h*t it."," I have. A sweet brunette, eight o'clock. Nine o'clock. Ten; thirty. She's walking to the bar.  Hey four-eyes. You got astigmatism or something? I'm sorry, I was trying to be playful but I just got out of a lonf relationship. I have no idea what I'm doing! I'm Marshall."
Barney, Nice recovery. I think it's working.," Hi Marshall. Amy. Don't worry, I've been there. Hold on.  Um, Amy, this is my friend Barney. Barney, this is Amy."
Barney," Hi. Amy, do you like... magic?"," Hey Barney, nice to meet you.  I hate you."
Barney, I am so sorry. It's a sickness. I'm the real victim here., I hate you.  Twice! Twice in a row you took my candy! That was my candy!
Barney, I know but tonight...," Twice! Twice in a row you took my candy! That was my candy!  No, forget it. You're such a jackass!"
Barney," I though you were gonna call me a jerk. All right, I'm sorry. But I will make it up to you. Tonight, we'll go to a college bar near NYU. The Scorpion & The Toad. I figure in a younger crowd you'll seem more mature, more worldly. And, as a third-year law student, more smarter."," No, forget it. You're such a jackass!  OK, but no magic.(He turns to Barney who disappeared).How did you do that?"
Barney," I'm taking a leak, dumb-ass."," OK, but no magic.(He turns to Barney who disappeared).How did you do that?  Robin and I went apartment hunting with Aunt Lily."
Barney," Marshall Eriksen, suit up!"," I hope this is my new home.(She comes in the apartment)Yeah, I'm gonna take that first apartment.  No way."
Barney, Yeah you're good in that. Let's go., No way.  Wait. Empty your pockets. Come on.
Barney, Come on..., Wait. Empty your pockets. Come on.  Sleeves.
Barney, There is nothing in my sl..., Sleeves.  Oh is that right?
Barney, Huh? Huh? Let's go., Oh is that right?  Behind my ear.
Barney, Oh there is nothing behind your... Ohh!, Behind my ear.  Ohh!At The Scorpion & the Toad bar.
Barney," You must be majoring in chemistry 'cause what I'm picking up between us is, uh...(The girl leaves / to the girl's friend)College lesbian phase."," Oh, tell me about it. I'm a third year at Columbia Law, so... If the workload does k*ll you I can probably get a conviction. Yeah.  Listen, I gotta go. But it'd be great to see you again."
Barney," Hi, I'm Barney."," Great. Nice.  Oh, no."
Barney, Do you mind giving my friend your phone number?," Oh, no.  Sure."
Barney," Sorry buddy, I'm taking this one too."," Whoo! I did it! I got a girl's phone number! Oh, and her handwriting is so cute. Look. I'll take her out for Chinese food and then we'll walk through the park. It'll be so... What?  I'll k*ll you!"
Barney, I'll k*ll you!," Sorry buddy, I'm taking this one too.  And then I discovered this area, North beach. Best beach ever! Oh, I've been blabbering on about my summer. How are you guys doing? And hey, how is Marshall?"
Barney, I'm not giving you..., Gimme the card! I swear I'm gonna...  Terrific.
Barney, Stop it!, The apartment is a metaphor for Marshall!(Robin gives back Ted his five dollars)  You don't want to see me when I'm angry!
Barney," Stop! If we can't settle this like gentlemen, then no one gets the number.(He sends the card across the window).", You don't want to see me when I'm angry!  Stop the cab!(Marshall gets out of the car)
Barney," No, wait. Come on. Wait. Marshall! 81st and 1st please.(He pulls the card out of his sleeve). Oh, she does have a cute handwriting.", Stop the cab!(Marshall gets out of the car)  About hangovers - everyone has their own special remedy.
Barney, Hi Marshall.," This guy like pennies!  No, go away, I don't want to talk to you."
Barney," OK. I know what I did a couple nights back was is in a moral grey area. But the great news is she loved you. If things had gone your way, you'd gone out a couple time, I think she definitely would've had sex with you."," No, go away, I don't want to talk to you.  There is no would in sex. There totally is. I'm just no good at this Barney! I'm good at being in a couple. I'm good at being Lily's boyfriend. Being single, forget it."
Barney," You can't give up now. What if I told you that you could relive that night with the exact same conversations, the exact same jokes, only this time you get her and I don't."," There is no would in sex. There totally is. I'm just no good at this Barney! I'm good at being in a couple. I'm good at being Lily's boyfriend. Being single, forget it.  That's not possible."
Barney," Oh, but it is. She has... Wait for it. Here it comes. Almost there...an identical twin. Yes!", That's not possible.  A twin isn't the same person.
Barney," Of course, it is. What do you think identical means? Ident- - same. -ical - person. Same person. Hey, we could double date.", A twin isn't the same person.  Fine.
Barney, Ah!," Fine.  But you have to promise me you're not gonna steal my new twin and leave me with your old, used-up twin."
Barney, Used-up? They're a human being Marshall.," But you have to promise me you're not gonna steal my new twin and leave me with your old, used-up twin.  So Uncle Marshall and Uncle Barney went out on a double date with the twins."
Barney, How are you doing?, So Uncle Marshall and Uncle Barney went out on a double date with the twins.  Great. Amazing. This is so much fun. Me and the girl are really cliking.
Barney," You are. You definitely are. Listen, you're gonna have to leave now. I just talked with the twins and, get this, I'm going home with both of them! Yeah. That's happening.", Great. Amazing. This is so much fun. Me and the girl are really cliking.  It is impossible that you're doing this to me again.
Barney, But they're twins., It is impossible that you're doing this to me again.  You said to me that being single would be like being in a candy store.
Barney," Well, it's not like a candy store. It's a lawless, post-apocalyptic wasteland. I may be your best friend...", You said to me that being single would be like being in a candy store.  Ted's my best friend.
Barney,"...but in this world it's every hombre for himself. That's what being single is. And after nine years of captivity, that is the single greatest lesson I can teach you about surviving in the wild. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have two unique breasts an two duplicates waiting for me.(Barney rejoins the twins, Marshall leaves the bar).Oh bad news. Marshall got food poisoning.", Ted's my best friend.  What?
Barney, Yeah. I guess we're just a threesome tonight., That's so bad. I really liked him.  Lily. What are you doing here?
Barney," So then, I was promoted to assistant m'nage-er. Manager. Why do I keep doing that?(Lily arrives.)Lily?"," Actually, there's maybe something you can do for me. But you can never ever ask me why.  You gave me Chlamydia, you jerk!(She throws a drink at his face and leaves)"
Barney," So, where was I? Ah yes. Assistant m'nage-er. I did it again. I can't believe it!"," You gave me Chlamydia, you jerk!(She throws a drink at his face and leaves)  You gave my twin sister Chlamydia! You slime!(She throws a second drink at his face and leaves, following by the twins)."
Barney," Wait, wait, I know magic. Well played, Eriksen. Well played."," You gave my twin sister Chlamydia! You slime!(She throws a second drink at his face and leaves, following by the twins)."
Barney, I can't say I blame you.," I'm going to k*ll him.  No, I mean I'm seriously going to k*ll him."
Barney," Dude, you can't whip that out at brunch."," Lily is evil! She just wore that dress to t*rture me. Well, you know what? Two can play at that game. See, at brunch, I'm going to t*rture Lily right back. Yeah. There's a part of my body that she's got a weakness for, too.  No, not that. I'm going to unleash my calves."
Barney, That's crazy. Nobody's turned on by men's calves. They're a thoroughly unerotic body part.," No, not that. I'm going to unleash my calves.  Well, yeah, I'd say that, too, if I had those skinny little chicken legs."
Barney, I'll be waiting by the phone for your apology.," Well, yeah, I'd say that, too, if I had those skinny little chicken legs.  So Marshall showed up at brunch with a plan."
Barney, I can't say I blame you.," I'm going to k*ll him.  No, I mean I'm seriously going to k*ll him."
Barney, Uh... I'm here to meet your parents. They must be dying to meet me after all the legendary Barney stories you've told them.," Barney, what are you doing here?  I haven't told them any legendary Barney stories."
Barney, What?," I haven't told them any legendary Barney stories.  Barney, here is a list of all the things I talk with my dad about: baseball."
Barney, But I'm your best friend.," Barney, here is a list of all the things I talk with my dad about: baseball.  Well, actually Marshall's my..."
Barney, I'm the most important person in your life.," Well, actually Marshall's my...  Well, Robin's actually..."
Barney, How could your parents not know about me? I'm delightful.," Well, Robin's actually...  To us, sure, in very small, infrequent doses. I mean, come on, you're not exactly the kind of friend parents want their kid to have."
Barney," Oh, really? Then I guess those shoes aren't the thing you're most wrong about today."," To us, sure, in very small, infrequent doses. I mean, come on, you're not exactly the kind of friend parents want their kid to have.  Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad."
Barney, Barney Stinson. An honor to meet the two of you. That needlepoint Bless This Mess pillow you made for Ted - what a stitch. Stitch! Did that just happen?(Ted's parents and Barney laugh)," I know you've all been excited to meet...  Uh, Mom, Dad, this is my girlfriend, Robin."
Barney," San Marino! Oh, you're serious? Yikes. No. We have to try Casa A Pezzi. Best salmon risotto I have ever had."," That's funny, I didn't even look in the mirror today. That's not anything, is it? So, I made a reservation at San Marino tonight for 8:00.  I love salmon risotto."
Barney, I know., I love salmon risotto.  How are we supposed to get a table at Casa A Pezzi? They're booked for weeks.
Barney," Well, lucky for you, I happen to know the head waitress, which is ironic because..."," How are we supposed to get a table at Casa A Pezzi? They're booked for weeks.  Stop it! Don't, don't!"
Barney," Ironic because we both work at a homeless shelter where I serve the food. Where do you volunteer, Robin?"," Stop it! Don't, don't!  What's the matter with you? I'm his girlfriend, and I'm not even trying that hard. Way to wreck the curve, kiss-ass."
Barney," Robin, I'm his best friend. That's a commitment. Girlfriend? That's like a bad flu. Out of your system after a couple weeks in bed. High five!"," What's the matter with you? I'm his girlfriend, and I'm not even trying that hard. Way to wreck the curve, kiss-ass.  Can I help?"
Barney," Yes, you can, Virginia. There's a story behind that broach, and I'm going to hear it."," Can I help?  Well, funny you should ask..."
Barney," Whoa! Bravo, Barney. Oh, oh oh!"," Well, funny you should ask...  That is my all-time favorite sonata.Barney, you are just delightful."
Barney," No, Virginia, you're delightful, I am deligh-ted. And he's just Ted. I'm really not planning these things; they just keep happening."," That is my all-time favorite sonata.Barney, you are just delightful.  Whoops. I think I dropped an ice cube down here. Ow, it's so cold."
Barney, Anyone up for a drink at MacLaren's?," All right, that's it, I'm out of here. In a minute.  No, I'm kind of tired."
Barney," St. Peter's, 8:45 a.m., it's my favorite service."," I'd join you, too, but I want to get up early for Mass tomorrow.  Wait a minute. You're able to cross the threshold of a church?"
Barney, I'll save you a seat.," Wait a minute. You're able to cross the threshold of a church?  Oh, you are just terrific. Isn't he, Susan?"
Barney," Susan, her name is Virginia."," Robin.  Dude, I am sincerely ticked at your dad right now."
Barney," Dude, I am sincerely ticked at your dad right now."," Susan, her name is Virginia.  Why?"
Barney," Last night, we go to MacLaren's for a drink, right?"," Why?  So Barney darts back into the burning house, lifts up the refrigerator I'm pinned under and pulls me to safety."
Barney," Oh, I'm no hero, Wendy. You know who is a hero? My Dalmatian, Smokey. He... didn't... make it out. I'm sorry."," Wow. You're like a hero.  You poor, brave man."
Barney, I'm... oh.(They hug).," Why don't you give the guy a hug?  My dad was your wingman? This is really messing with my head. Barney, is... Is my dad cool?"
Barney," I'm not done. So, your dad stays to finish his drink, but I take off because I have to be up early for Mass with your mom."," My dad was your wingman? This is really messing with my head. Barney, is... Is my dad cool?  Sure."
Barney," Anyway, I realize that I left my phone on the bar, so I come back..."," Sure.  Barney arrives in the bar, sees Ted's father making out with Wendy and takes a photo of them with his phone. Back at the apartment, he hands Ted the phone)"
Barney, I know. Can you believe your dad rack-jacked me like that?," Oh, my God! Is that really...? Oh, my God!  My dad made out with Wendy the waitress? He cheated on my mom? No, that's impossible."
Barney," Ted, it's a well-known statistic that 83% of people married longer than six months are seeing someone on the side."," My dad made out with Wendy the waitress? He cheated on my mom? No, that's impossible.  Do you know that when you make up a statistic, you always use 83%?"
Barney," You think I'm lying. Well, have you done any surveys on the subject? Because the good people atwww.swingers.open-marriage-is-natural-l ... lygamy.orghave, and they beg to differ."," Do you know that when you make up a statistic, you always use 83%?  That's not a real Web site."
Barney," Oh, and I suppose I didn't get a real T-shirt for running in their 10K."," That's not a real Web site.  Hi, Dad."
Barney," Well, you didn't get your dad's close-the-deal gene, that's for sure."," I wanted to confront him, but I couldn't. I guess I got the let's-not-talk-about-anything-uncomfortable gene  Smile!"
Barney," Ooh, a piano!"," Good. Focus on your job now, because your career clock is ticking. There's time for marriage and kids and all that other stuff later.  You lucked out with my mom last night, huh? What a relief, right?"
Barney, What happened to Marshall and Lily?," Come on, she was just frowning under direct light. And besides, that's not even what I liked about her. It was her... It's not important.  They've been fighting lately. They're probably off somewhere going at it."
Barney," You know, he mentioned he was divorced last night. I totally spaced on that. Ooh, no line at the omelet station."," Teddy bear, oh...  Lily... I'm sorry that I said all those things."
Barney," Oh, no, what'd you fight about?(He puts his headphones on)."," We had our first fight.  A few months ago, my architecture firm was approached to design this new building..."
Barney, No.," So anyway, the head architect unveils his new design to the whole company.  Yes."
Barney," Yeah, you did."," Wow, so it's the whole package.  Had to."
Barney," Oh, dude, if they're selling condos, you got to get me in. And don't give me the shaft."," Had to.  Yeah, you did."
Barney, Had to.," Yeah, you did.  It's a travesty. It's gonna define the skyline of the city. If it was me, I could've designed something amazing. Instead, I'm spending 12 hours a day designing the cornices."
Barney, Can we talk about something else?," Then at the end of the movie when he has a catch with his dad, like... Like he never did when he was young enough for it to matter.  You know what, dude? Forget about Robin, okay? You're hanging with us tonight. I've got an awome party lined up."
Barney," Oh, God! This gonna be another one of your weird all-guy parties?"," You know what, dude? Forget about Robin, okay? You're hanging with us tonight. I've got an awome party lined up.  That was a poker game. What is wrong with you? No, it's the first law school party of the year and it's gonna be awesome. I haven't seen this guys since, like, last year before Lily and I broke up. So I'm gonna have to break the news to everybody. It's really gonna bum them out. This party's gonna suck."
Barney," Well, love to join you at that one. But I got tickets to Foxy Boxing."," That was a poker game. What is wrong with you? No, it's the first law school party of the year and it's gonna be awesome. I haven't seen this guys since, like, last year before Lily and I broke up. So I'm gonna have to break the news to everybody. It's really gonna bum them out. This party's gonna suck.  I wish I could join you guys, but I got to get back to my apparently boring job."
Barney," Dude, lots of chicks think architects are hot. Think about it, you create something out of nothing. You're like God. There's nobody hotter than God.", Robin thinks so.  I love it when you quote Scripture.
Barney," I'm telling you, you should use the architect angle with the ladies."," I love it when you quote Scripture.  Okay, first of all, I have a girlfriend. Second, the architect angle doesn't even work on her. And, third, I can't imagine that working on anyone ever."
Barney," That's 'cause you're always like...(Dully)Ted Mosby, architect. If it were me, I'd be like...(Confidently)Ted Mosby, architect. Anything sounds impressive when it's said with the right attitude."," Okay, first of all, I have a girlfriend. Second, the architect angle doesn't even work on her. And, third, I can't imagine that working on anyone ever.  Marshall Ericksen. Recently dumped and heading to a lame party. Whoa. Whoa, ladies, please take it easy. There's enough of me for everyone. Oh. Hi. Hello. All right. We're gonna take off.."
Barney," Wait up, I'll leave with you guys. Ted Mosby, architect. Trust me."," Marshall Ericksen. Recently dumped and heading to a lame party. Whoa. Whoa, ladies, please take it easy. There's enough of me for everyone. Oh. Hi. Hello. All right. We're gonna take off..  Hey, just out of curiosity. If a guy told you he was an architect, what would you think of that?"
Barney, Thank God you're here. Can you help with this? I need nails.," What do you think you're...? Barney?  Okay, I'm totally lost here. Where's Ted?"
Barney, Ted? He's at work.," Okay, I'm totally lost here. Where's Ted?  How did you get here?"
Barney, Awesome story. As per usual., How did you get here?  How do you think Mr. Brady scored a babe like Carol?
Barney," Sorry, I forgot my binocs for Foxy Boxing. Whoo, looks like things just got a little foxier right here."," Yes, she did.  Yes, they did. And you're just in time. Girls, I got to go, but I'm leaving you in very good, if slightly sullied hands."
Barney," Yeah, stay(mouthing go)"," Don't go. We don't even know your name to look out for your buildings.  Excuse us for one second.(To Barney)Okay, you were right - the architect thing totally works. But I've got a girlfriend and I've got to get back to work. This project is getting harder and harder."
Barney," Yeah, you did."," Excuse us for one second.(To Barney)Okay, you were right - the architect thing totally works. But I've got a girlfriend and I've got to get back to work. This project is getting harder and harder.  Yeah, had to. See ya.(He leaves)"
Barney," Sorry, my, uh... intern had to leave."," Yeah, had to. See ya.(He leaves)  Oh, well, that's too bad. I'm Anna, by the way."
Barney, Ted Mosby... Architect.," Oh, well, that's too bad. I'm Anna, by the way.  But none of that acclaim means anything compared to the joy of seeing the sun rise over your first building."
Barney, But none of that acclaim means anything compared to the joy of seeing the sun rise over your first building.," Ted Mosby... Architect.  Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up!"
Barney, Galloping.," Dude, dude, what are you doing?  All right, you proved it. The whole Ted Mosby, architect thing works."
Barney, It is tonight.," Aren't you afraid a certain somebody might find out about this? I mean, this isn't you, Ted.  And that led to a couple of hours that I cannot, as a gentleman, divulge to you. We did it right here, and here and here."
Barney," And that led to a couple of hours that I cannot, as a gentleman, divulge to you. We did it right here, and here and here.", It is tonight.  But why would you use Ted's name?
Barney, I've had some recent bad press on the World Wide Web. So I'm taking a T.O. on the whole using my real name thing.," But why would you use Ted's name?  Oh, this is great. It wasn't Ted. Everything's okay."
Barney," And thus ended this chapter of, Let's pour our hearts out in the bedroom of Barney's one-night stand. Come on, let's go before she gets out of the shower."," Well, guess what, I haven't been crazy or jealous or paranoid in months, and I really miss it.  You're such a pig. You're not even going to say good-bye?"
Barney," I'll have you know I composed a lovely form letter for use in just such an occasion. Just fill out her name and then... Something with a A. A... A... I'll just put resident. Go, go, go, go.", You're such a pig. You're not even going to say good-bye?  Robin took a long walk that night. She thought about how opening yourself up to another person usually means opening yourself up to going a little crazy. She thought about how much easier it was just to be alone. And then she came to see me.
Barney," Dear Resident... The time we spent together, however long it was, meant the world to me. I would love to see you again, but unfortunately, I cannot. You see, I am a ghost. I can't only materialize once every decade on the anniversary of my death. I chose to spend my one day among the living with you, sweet... Resident. Perhaps we will meet again in another decade, provided you keep your figure. Until then, all my love from the beyond. Barney."," Okay, but I don't want you expecting 78 storeys or anything.(They kiss again)  Barney? Who the hell is Barney?"
Barney, Aaaaaaah!," Your Uncle Barney was always a bit of an enigma. In all the years we lived in new york, none of us had ever set foot in his apartment. Until one day, one of us did.  Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!"
Barney, The fortress of barnitude? No way.," What about your place, Barney? I know it's shrouded in mystery, but it's gotta have a couch.  Come on. She's desperate."
Barney," Hmm, normally a prerequisite for the women I bring home, but... pass."," Come on. She's desperate.  One of you guys is very, very lucky because I have... A boom! An extra ticket to the Alanis Morissette concert. Who's in?"
Barney," Okay,I'll take the over on the Pittsburgh game. Oh and P. to the S., I never got my payout from Seattle from two weeks ago. Yeah. Don't make me call the gaming commission on you. I'm sure they'd be very interested to know what's going on over there. All right? All right? Okay, I love you too Mom. Take care.(He hangs up)Hello Lily. You've somehow managed to circumvent my security. How did you do it?"," God, I hate being single!  Ted gave me your spare key."
Barney," That's terrible. Well, see ya."," I'm sorry,but you know I'd only come here if I had no other choice. But earlier today, I was getting ready to go to sleep and...  Wait, can I stay here maybe?"
Barney," I'd let you, but I don't have any room."," Wait, can I stay here maybe?  You live in a two-bedroom apartment. You have one room just for your suits."
Barney," Hey I'm at a point in my life where my suits are my family. Look around you Lily. You are in the heart of bachelor country, and as a woman, you are an illegal immigrant here. Now,you can try to apply for a sex visa, but that only lasts 12 hours. 14 if you qualify for multiple entry."," You live in a two-bedroom apartment. You have one room just for your suits.  Ewww!...Is something some lame, judgmental chick would say, but I say give me multiple high fives."
Barney," Wow, you really are desperate."," Ewww!...Is something some lame, judgmental chick would say, but I say give me multiple high fives.  I really am."
Barney," Oh okay, you can stay here for two days. But I only have one rule. You can't change anything.", I really am.  Why would I change anything? This place is... Perfect. Except for the fact that you don't have a TV.
Barney," See that wall? 300-inch flat-screen. They only sell them in Japan, but I know a guy. Had to ship it over in a tugboat like freakin' King Kong.", Why would I change anything? This place is... Perfect. Except for the fact that you don't have a TV.  It hurts my eyes.
Barney, Yeah. That doesn't go away.," It hurts my eyes.  Hey, where have you been?"
Barney," Uhm, smells delicious."," I don't care what either of you say, I am going to the Popover Pantry with Brad. We're here. We're hungry. Get used to it, brunch.  Thank you. There was no food in the fridge, so I picked up...(Barney puts the breakfast in the trash)What are you doing?"
Barney," Lily, what was the first rule again?"," Thank you. There was no food in the fridge, so I picked up...(Barney puts the breakfast in the trash)What are you doing?  Don't change anything?"
Barney, And what was the second rule?, Don't change anything?  There was no second rule.
Barney, Exactly! There was only one rule and you broke it., There was no second rule.  I bought groceries. That counts as changing something?
Barney," Lily, if I wanted a fridge full of groceries or fresh coffee in the morning, I'd be in a relationship. But I don't want to be in a relationship. That's why I make it crystal-clear to every girl that walks through that door that this is not a place to leave a toothbrush. This is not a place to leave a contact lens case. This is a place to leave. Come on, 'll give you a tour. Uh, no flash photography please.Bienvenidoto the bedroom. Dig this: King-sized bed, full-sized blanket, one pillow. Everything about this bed says our work here is done. Next we saybienvenueto the bathroom. What, only one towel? What, no hairdryer? You know where I keep that stuff? Your place. b*at it. And thecoup de gr'ce... Yeah, that's right. Patent-pending. Andwilkommento the hallway. While guys like Ted and Marshall may hide their p*rn...", I bought groceries. That counts as changing something?  Marshall doesn't have p*rn.
Barney," Aww, that's sweet. While guys like Ted and Marshall may hide their p*rn, I had mine professionally lit. Girls see this, they can't get out of here fast enough."," Marshall doesn't have p*rn.  And if that doesn't drive them away, there's always your life-sized storm-trooper."
Barney," No,that's just awesome. So you see, whenever a girl wakes up here, I never have to tell her to go build her nest somewhere else. My apartment does it for me."," And if that doesn't drive them away, there's always your life-sized storm-trooper.  God, I love brunch."
Barney, Hey. Did the cold wake you?," Yeah!  No,I've just been watching you sleep."
Barney," Oh,did you try and take a shower? I'm sorry, I only have one clean towel."," No,I've just been watching you sleep.  I don't buy into the myth that we need to shower every day."
Barney," Okay. I'd offer you some coffee, but I don't have any, so you're gonna have to..."," I don't buy into the myth that we need to shower every day.  I'm boycotting coffee. You may as well drink the tears of a colombian peasant farmer. God, I love this place. Good thing I don't have a job because I could stay here all day."
Barney," I think I left something on the bookshelf. Whoops. Oh, no, oh, look(he shows her his p*rn)Oh, I'm disgusting."," I'm boycotting coffee. You may as well drink the tears of a colombian peasant farmer. God, I love this place. Good thing I don't have a job because I could stay here all day.  Wow, you're open about your sexuality and that's one of the reasons I love you. Did I just say that? Oh well. Cat's out of the bag. I love you."
Barney," Whoa, uh, okay. Beep beep. Backing up, um..."," Wow, you're open about your sexuality and that's one of the reasons I love you. Did I just say that? Oh well. Cat's out of the bag. I love you.  Barney... Oh!"
Barney, What? No. Yes!, Oh my god! Are you married? Is this your wife?  Yes?
Barney, Yes., Yes?  You son of a bitch! I can't believe I let you enter my sacred temple.
Barney," Come on, baby. please, no. You don't understand. What have I done? This is the worst. How could you...?(The girl is gone. To Lily)You're not going anywhere. Live claritin clear. Wow, that was close. That hippie chick wouldn't leave. She was ready to squat here."," You son of a bitch! I can't believe I let you enter my sacred temple.  Well, she'd have to with your spring-loaded toilet seat, wouldn't she?"
Barney, She was freakishly immune to everything in my apartment... Except you. You're better than p*rn.," Well, she'd have to with your spring-loaded toilet seat, wouldn't she?  Thank you."
Barney," How would you like to extend your stay here? All you'd have to do is pretend to be my wife, and scare off the occasional one-night stand. I know,I know. You've got your ethics. You've got your principles...", Thank you.  I'll do it.
Barney, Really?," I'll do it.  Barney,you've clearly got some serious mother issues that have left you the emotional equivalent of a scavenging sewer rat. But, in my other apartment, I would be living with an actual scavenging sewer rat, so you win."
Barney, I'll take it.At MacLaren's:," Barney,you've clearly got some serious mother issues that have left you the emotional equivalent of a scavenging sewer rat. But, in my other apartment, I would be living with an actual scavenging sewer rat, so you win. Mamma mia!?"
Barney, Can you pass the arts and leisure? (The girl does it. More loudly) Can you pass the arts and leisure?," I was thinking like this collared shirt and these pin...(Ted and Robin laugh)Oh, you know what? Shut up.  I just did."
Barney," Lily, I can explain..."," Honey, I'm... Barney, what the hell is going on here?  How could you? In our own home?(She slaps him)You bastard!"
Barney, Brava. That was incredible. And that slap was genius. You did not hold back.," Just get out. This is what I get after I worked as a stripper for four years to put you through medical school? I got breast implants for you. I...(The girl is gone)I was just about to turn on the tears.  Yeah, that I just always wanted to do."
Barney," Fair enough. I have to say, it's kind of nice having food around here for a change."," Yeah, that I just always wanted to do.  You know... Oh nah, never mind."
Barney, What? You're my wife. You can tell me anything.," You know... Oh nah, never mind.  Well,if you really wanted to sell this ruse, we should try to make this place a little more... You know, homey. Like... Like a woman would actually live here."
Barney, What did you have in mind?," Well,if you really wanted to sell this ruse, we should try to make this place a little more... You know, homey. Like... Like a woman would actually live here.  Hey,you're home. I didn't think we'd be seeing you until tomorrow morning."
Barney," Hey, if my bed's going suit up, it's going to do it right. Want to give it a whirl?"," Oh,I think we made the right decision going for the custom-made italian sheets.  Oh. Ooooh!"
Barney," All right, I'm going to head out, h*t the bars. What are you going to do tonight?"," Oh. Ooooh!  Oh, I was just going to watch Letterman but, God this bed is so comfy. I wish you had a TV in here.(Barney turns on a another wall-size TV)Okay, seriously, what do you do for a living?"
Barney, Please.(He settles himself on the bed)," Oh, I was just going to watch Letterman but, God this bed is so comfy. I wish you had a TV in here.(Barney turns on a another wall-size TV)Okay, seriously, what do you do for a living?  I thought you were going out."
Barney, Eh. After the monologue.," I thought you were going out.  The next morning, as the sun rose over Manhattan, your Uncle Marshall headed over to Brad's apartment to leave for the wedding in Vermont. But when he got there..."
Barney, Aaaaaah!, I don't know. I think he's in love with me.  Aaaaaaaaaaah!
Barney, I can't believe we just... You and I... What have we done?, Aaaaaaaaaaah!  Nothing. Nothing happened. We... We just went to sleep.
Barney, Just went to sleep? I don't sleep in the same bed as a woman and not make a move. How could... You! You spooned me against my will.," Nothing. Nothing happened. We... We just went to sleep.  Hey,it takes two to cuddle."
Barney," We... We redecorated my place. We stayed in on a friday night to watch Letterman, and then slept together and didn't have sex? Oh my God! We're in a relationship!"," Hey,it takes two to cuddle.  That's what you think a relationship is?"
Barney," You were supposed to be the vaccine, but you gave me the disease. You gotta go."," That's what you think a relationship is?  Barney. I don't think you're mad at me. You're mad at yourself. You let down your guard, and let someone into your life, and... And it actually felt okay. And that terrifies you."
Barney, Uh-uh. You gotta go.," Barney. I don't think you're mad at me. You're mad at yourself. You let down your guard, and let someone into your life, and... And it actually felt okay. And that terrifies you.  Hey, you can't just kick me out! I put a lot of work into this place, and I've grown accustomed to a certain standard of living."
Barney, A certain standard of living? You didn't pay a single...," Hey, you can't just kick me out! I put a lot of work into this place, and I've grown accustomed to a certain standard of living.  And so Mr. and Mrs. Stinson, after two weeks of marriage, decided to call it quits. Fortunately, they reached a settlement. And that's the story of how Aunt Lily furnished her apartment."
Barney," Oh, hi, Lily. We were just in the neighborhood, thought we'd get some lunch. We didn't even know you'd be here.(Marshall takes a photo of her).", I'm sorry.  What do you want?
Barney, I didn't catch your name. Did you guys catch her name?," Aloha, island visitors. The big wave brought you to our humble luau. For that, we thank you. Or in my native tongue, mahalo.  No."
Barney," Really? Laid, you say?"," Yeah, well, it was supposed to be, but my professor's like the toughest grader I've ever seen. She had like a bad divorce this summer and now she's taking it out on us. To tell you the truth, I think she just needs to get laid.  You wouldn't be into her.She's, like, in her late 40s."
Barney, She hot?," You wouldn't be into her.She's, like, in her late 40s.  Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah."
Barney, And she's looking for some action. Sounds to me like she could be a cougar.," Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah.  A what?"
Barney," A cougar. An older woman, usually in her 40s or 50s, single and on the prowl for a younger man.", A what?  What's a woman in her 60s or 70s? A turtle?
Barney," Marshall, I've thought it over and I accept your challenge.", What's a woman in her 60s or 70s? A turtle?  I didn't challenge you to have sex with...
Barney," Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins."," I didn't challenge you to have sex with...  So, I quit my job. I just couldn't take it anymore. Approximately 50 times a day, some guy asks me for a lei..."
Barney," Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure. Real classy, Ted."," It was an whole chicken. And did I mention she had 12 sides?  So, Lily, what do you say? Do you want the job?"
Barney," Okay, let's take a look. Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right. A prime specimen. See, you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics. Start with the hair. The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage. The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar until he's already being dragged, helpless, back to her lair. Now, the blouse. The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey. If you're watching them bounce, she's about to pounce. See the claws? Long and sharp, to ward off rival females... Or open alimony checks. Yeah, this one's a beaut. Okay, let the hunt begin."," Okay, wait, wait, wait. That's professor Lewis's office there.  Wait, wait, wait.I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with you hunting my constitutional law professor."
Barney," Who do you rather have grading your papers: a savage, man-eating jungle cat, or a purring, satisfied kitty?"," Wait, wait, wait.I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with you hunting my constitutional law professor.  Go, Barney. Go mount and stuff that cougar."
Barney," Scusi, I am Luigi, italian exchange student. I was, uh, walking to class, but then I noticed you... Bella principessa..."," Go, Barney. Go mount and stuff that cougar.  Tell me what you want or get out."
Barney, Direct. I like that. The name's Barney. What I want... is you., Tell me what you want or get out.  Turn around. My place. Two hours. Don't be tardy.
Barney," Oh, my god. Incredible."," Are you kidding? He's Hammond Druthers. He's a legend. I'm just part of his team. This building is huge for the firm, so it's really important we don't blow it.(Giggles)All right, enough!  Hmm... C minus."
Barney, C minus? What are you talking about? I just pulled an all-nighter!," Hmm... C minus.  You didn't budget your time well, you glossed over some of the most important points, and your oral presentation was sloppy and inconclusive."
Barney," I know, I know."," I'd ask you how last night went, but we had a pop quiz today. Nobody got higher than a c-minus.  You claim to have so much sex. I only assumed you'd be good at it."
Barney," Look, I miscalculated. I thought she'd be old and fragile, like most cougars. But kitty's got claws. Don't worry though. Tonight, I'm seeing her again."," You claim to have so much sex. I only assumed you'd be good at it.  Just let it go, man. You're making things worse."
Barney," I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet, and I its master."," Just let it go, man. You're making things worse.  I think I'm falling in love with you."
Barney, I think I'm falling in love with you.," I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet, and I its master.  Oh, God. That wasn't your first time, was it? Although that would explain a lot."
Barney, What? No.We had sex yesterday.," Oh, God. That wasn't your first time, was it? Although that would explain a lot.  Oh, right. That. Well, you had sex yesterday. I revised my syllabus for the spring semester."
Barney, Do you not see the powerbar in my hand? I'm fueling up.," Dude, you're k*lling me. You didn't tame the cougar. You just made her angrier.  So you're going back over there?"
Barney," Oh, yeah. And tonight, just like John Mellencamp, I am going to get rid of the cougar once and for all. Get it? 'Cause that's what he did with his name.", So you're going back over there?  I can't stop thinking about you. Please give me another chance.
Barney, I can't stop thinking about you. Please give me another chance.," Oh, yeah. And tonight, just like John Mellencamp, I am going to get rid of the cougar once and for all. Get it? 'Cause that's what he did with his name.  Barney, I teach all day. It's the last thing I want to do when I get home."
Barney," But you don't understand. See, I've been going easy on you, holding back, 'cause I was afraid you'd break a hip or something. But, this time, no mercy.I don't care how long it takes days, weeks, half a year."," Barney, I teach all day. It's the last thing I want to do when I get home.  Fine.Come in. You can start while I finish grading some papers."
Barney," That's not true. It's just temporarily dislocated. Seriously, I'm fine."," He broke his hip.  No, he's not fine."
Barney," Yeah, she was.", Mr. Eriksen. Hello. I graded your paper tonight. I was pleasantly surprised.  B plus.
Barney," B-plus?! Marshall, after I've gone through my eight weeks of physical therapy, I am going to get you that A!", B plus.  Let her go. She belongs out there in the wild. You should feel proud. You fought the cougar and lived.
Barney, It was an amazing safari. I can't wait to show you guys the slides!, Let her go. She belongs out there in the wild. You should feel proud. You fought the cougar and lived.
Barney, Hanging out at a coffee place is not nearly as much fun as hanging out at a bar.," Yup.  Man, what's that?"
Barney, Somebody thinks you're me.," That cute coffee girl wrote a heart by your name. Somebody has a crush on you.  Do you really think she likes me? I mean, I guess it's not that surprising. Every time I come in here, I totally crack her up."
Barney," Mine says... Swarley. How'd they get Swarley from Barney? It's not even a name. Who would ever be called Swarley? Oh, please don't start calling me Swarley. This would never happen at a bar! (He leaves)"," Mine says Ted, no heart.  Man! What's up with Swarley?"
Barney," Wow. It is foreign. I'm impressed, Ted. It's Moroccan, actually."," Hey, dude, by the way, I really like that suit. Tell me about the fabric. Is it foreign or something?  Whoa."
Barney," You weren't interested in my suit at all, were you?", I got a call for Swarley. Is there a Swarley here?  Swarley!
Barney, Stop calling me that.," Geez, can't you hear him, Swarley? There's a call for you.  Uh... Hey, I'd like you guys to officially meet Chloe."
Barney, Hi., Hi.  Hi. It's nice to meet you guys. I'll be right back.
Barney," Dude, you gotta ditch her.", It's right back there. Right? Right? She's hot! And she likes me? She likes Italian food. I also like Italian food. She likes Billy Joel. I also like... music. And I think we're going to go out again.  Obviously.
Barney, She's got the crazy eyes., Why?  Dude. The eyes. They're crazy.
Barney," It's a well-documented condition of the pupils, or pupi."," What are you guys talking about, the crazy eyes?  No. Just pupils."
Barney, It's an indicator of future mental instability., No. Just pupils.  She does not have the crazy eyes.
Barney," She was too far away in the coffee place, but when I saw her up close just now..."," You just can't see it because you're afflicted with haven't been laid in a while blindness.  Hey, I'd like you guys to officially meet Chloe."
Barney, Hi., Hi.  Hi. (With crazy eyes) It's nice to meet you guys.
Barney," You can keep going out with her, but you're gonna regret it. One time, I met a girl at this very bar. I saw that she had the crazy eyes... But I ignored it. And then, sure enough."," Guys, I'm not going to stop dating Chloe just because you think she has the crazy eyes.  Barney, can I ask you a question?"
Barney, Anything.," Barney, can I ask you a question?  Would you like to have a threesome?"
Barney, Of course.," Would you like to have a threesome?  Great. It'll be you, me and Mr. Weasels."
Barney, No. It ended up being just a twosome with the third one watching from a chair.," So, did you do it?  Which one were you?"
Barney, I'd rather not say.," Which one were you?  Look, there was a time I didn't believe in the crazy eyes either, and then I met Jeanine. She had serious crazy eyes. I told myself I was just imagining it, but then..."
Barney," I've had one of those. Makes up stories to get attention. Went out with her for three weeks, her dad died twice."," So, she's needy crazy. That's one of the worst kinds.  Guys, she was really freaked out, okay? Maybe the story is true."
Barney, What in the world would make you believe that's a true story?," Guys, she was really freaked out, okay? Maybe the story is true.  She's really hot."
Barney, They always are.," She's really hot.  You all done with that, Ted?"
Barney, Ned. I told you to call him Ned., Yeah.  That's just sad.
Barney," No. Okay? No. No more. I will not let this become a thing. It's over. No more Swarley. No Swarlz. No more Swar-lay. No more Swar... wait for it... ley. No more Bob Swarley, man. No more. No! It's over. Do you understand?", What's up Swarlz?  Yes.
Barney," Thank you. (He leaves, a call me Swarley sign on his back)", Yes.  Nice.
Barney," Relax, you've got nothing to worry about. The girl's crazy.", Oh. For his date. Good for him. Hope he has a good time tonight.  Thanks!
Barney," He'll just have wild monkey sex with her five times, max, and be done with her.", Thanks!  Thanks again.
Barney, What are you doing?," Thanks again.  I just wanted to listen to a little music, that's all."
Barney," Ha-ha! Now I'm a woman. I love it! You know, I was thinking about this whole new name thing last night, and you know what I realized? I like it."," And this next one's going out to Swarley. All your friends know you miss Barney, but he's gone, and you got to accept that, baby. And, Swarley, you're gonna be  a better woman for it. Here's I Am Woman by Helen Reddy.  You like being called Swarley?"
Barney, Are you kidding? I want you to call me that., You like being called Swarley?  Do you really think this is gonna work?
Barney," Do I think what's gonna work? I'm just saying, I love my new name, so please only call me that from now on.", Do you really think this is gonna work?  Call you what?
Barney," You know, that-that-that new name that you've been calling me.", Call you what?  Say it.
Barney, Why? You guys know what it is., Say it.  Say the name.
Barney," No, I don't want to! I hate it! I hate it! It's not funny! It's never been funny! I've never done any... No! (He leaves)"," Say the name.  Man, he is really gonna lose it when all the magazine subscriptions start coming in."
Barney," I'm thinking. How about this? On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, you..."," Okay, I ran it by the group, and we decided we're gonna give you a choice. We will agree to stop calling you Swarley, but instead, we'll call you Jennifer. Well?  Hey! Look at this."
Barney," Roland? Your name's Roland. That's funny, right? Rock and Roland. Warsaw is the capital of what? Roland. You're Monica Roland-ski. Hey, yeah, that's just how I Roland."," It's nice to meet you, Roland. I'll see you guys later.  Nice try, Swarley."
Barney, Damn it.," Nice try, Swarley.  Swarley!"
Barney," Hey, guys.", You got it.  Wow. A pedicure.
Barney," Uh, if there were any shame in a dude getting a pedicure I don't think there would have been a feature about it in Details magazine.", Wow. A pedicure.  We're going to Atlantic City to elope right now!
Barney," Oh, congratulations, Lily. Marshall, you're getting married? What the hell?", We're going to Atlantic City to elope right now!  So are you in or not?
Barney," Hell, yeah, I'm in! Just... I'm almost done."," So are you in or not?  No, we got to get going to the..."
Barney," Ah, A.C., always in decline, never hitting bottom. It's good to be back, old friend.", And something blue. Somebody should really check on this lady.  You been here before?
Barney," Oh, uh, once or twice.", You been here before?  Barney!
Barney," Ah, good to see you, too. Three times, maybe.", Barney!  The wedding chapel... This is it. Are you ready to do this?
Barney, Yeah.," I'm ready. Let's get married.  Oh, crap. I don't have a veil. I'm a bride, I can't get married without a veil. And a bouquet. I need a veil and a bouquet. Oh, my God, we're getting married."
Barney," No, you guys go ahead. I'm going to find the veil.(He leaves)"," Yeah, okay.  So this is it, right? The last 20 minutes of your single life. I'm proud of you, buddy."
Barney," Okay, I got the veil. She wasn't ready to be married. All right, let's talk bachelor party. Are we thinking full-on strip club, or should we rent a room and have a private toy show?"," Oh, yeah, definitely.  What did you just say?"
Barney," Marshall, I'm your best man."," Barney, no.  You're not my best man."
Barney," And as your best man, I have to throw you a bachelor party. That's part of being a best friend.", Right here.  You're not my best friend.
Barney, Of course.," Oh, good. Did you get the veil?  And it took us exactly' minutes. We went to a strip club."
Barney, Unbelievable!, Dude!  We weren't there for very long. It's not like I had time to have a lap dance or anything. I got a lap dance.
Barney, Bright side: the bachelor party continues!," About the marriage laws of the state where I work in a wedding chapel? Yeah, I'm pretty sure.  Yes! Continues? You mean start. He means start. We went to a strip club.Woman: Twenty-seven."
Barney, Hi.," Hey, it's Barney! Barney! (speaks Chinese language)...suit up!(both speak Chinese language) Legen-...-dary!"
Barney, See you.,(speaks Chinese language)...suit up!(both speak Chinese language) Legen-...-dary!  What the hell was that?
Barney, A... Chinese guy?," What the hell was that?  Hi. Hello. Uh, we need a marriage license, but we need to skip the waiting period because... We're in love."
Barney, Vultures.," Geez, you go to a vending machine for 30 seconds.  Psst.(They move away)"
Barney," Guys, let's bail. This is never gonna happen."," Sweet.  Look, I know this is turning into a bit of a disaster, but believe me, it's better than the alternative."
Barney," You throwing a big, free party with lots of booze and food and all your single, desperate girlfriends from college? Yeah, glad we dodged that b*llet."," Look, I know this is turning into a bit of a disaster, but believe me, it's better than the alternative.  Judge! Judge, come on. Come on, come on, come on!"
Barney, They broke up over the summer. Lily totally ran off to San Francisco and these two just had sex in the closet. What? We're under oath.," All right, what was that look? What's going on?  No, we're not."
Barney," Yeah, we are. He's a judge."," No, we're not.  Wh-- Did we take an oath? Do you even know what an oath is?"
Barney," Uh, yeah. Courthouse. Oath. We're under it.", Wh-- Did we take an oath? Do you even know what an oath is?  Guys. It's looking like this isn't gonna happen.
Barney, I can get us that money.," Deal. $5,000, okay, we can do that. Come on, everybody. Fork over your cash. Don't think. Just do it.  How?"
Barney, Have you noticed that all day today Chinese guys have been coming up and saying hi to me?, How?  Yes. Have you noticed I haven't asked about it because I'm too scared of the answer?
Barney," Well, those are my old gambling buddies. Truth is... I used to come here all the time. Play an old Chinese game called Shing Hasabu Shing. Had a small gambling problem. Actually, it wasn't so small. I kind of lost my entire life's savings. But tonight, I don't know, I'm feeling hot. I think I can win us that money."," Yes. Have you noticed I haven't asked about it because I'm too scared of the answer?  No, we're not letting you gamble all our money away."
Barney," Uh, it's not gambling if you absolutely know you're going to win. I'll get us that money. I swear it, nay... I oath it."," No, we're not letting you gamble all our money away.  Now, I had been to a lot of casinos before that night, and I've been to a lot of casinos since, but in all that time I've never seen a game quite like this one. To this day, I have no idea how it was played. But luckily, Barney did."
Barney," Marshall, please. Don't you think I know what I'm... My God, you're right."," I totally understand the game, Theodore. Barney, split your tiles. You can triple your money if you find the jellybean.  Wow. It's beautiful."
Barney," Did you guys see me? I was on f*re tonight. Man, I can't wait to get back to the shore. God, I love gambling!"," Thanks, Barney.  When we get home, we're gonna go to a little meeting. Okay?"
Barney, Why can't I do it just a little?," When we get home, we're gonna go to a little meeting. Okay?  Okay. Let's get this started."
Barney," Did I bet someone that they'd call it off? I did, didn't I? Who'd I bet?", After I spent all this money on a bridesmaid shirt?  You actually expect any of us are gonna come to your third wedding?
Barney," Oh, man, I'm so excited. I couldn't sleep last night. I bet you guys couldn't either."," Just Doc. He's creepy. I mean, the guy went to medical school. What's he doing living with six coal miners?  Why?"
Barney," Ah, only the gala event for the grand opening of Sharper Image's 500th store. Didn't you get my email?"," Why?  No, I blocked your address after the fourth time you sent me the video of the monkey sniffing his own butt."
Barney," Come on, it's on me! I'm buying three of you foot massagers and one of you a nose hair trimmer. You know who you are."," No, I blocked your address after the fourth time you sent me the video of the monkey sniffing his own butt.  Come on, let's go."
Barney," Come on, let's go."," Come on, it's on me! I'm buying three of you foot massagers and one of you a nose hair trimmer. You know who you are.  All right, I'm in."
Barney, To the Willowbrook Mall!," All right, I'm in.  To the Willowbrook Mall!"
Barney, Why not?," No, I don't go to malls! Sorry, I just don't like malls.  I'd rather not say."
Barney," Ted, you should be happy Robin has a secret. The more you learn about a person, the better chance you have of hitting the fatal 'oh' moment."," What, I don't get it, why won't Robin tell me why she hates malls?  The 'oh' moment?"
Barney," Yeah, that moment when you find out that one detail about a person that is going to be a deal breaker.", The 'oh' moment?  It's a promise ring. I made a pact with God to stay a virgin till I'm married.
Barney, Oh.," It's a promise ring. I made a pact with God to stay a virgin till I'm married.  I don't have an eating disorder. It's just when I put food in my mouth, I chew it and then I spit it out."
Barney, Oh.," I don't have an eating disorder. It's just when I put food in my mouth, I chew it and then I spit it out.  I just turned 30."
Barney, Oh.," I just turned 30.  So, trust me, you want to postpone knowing anything about each other for as long as possible."
Barney," So, trust me, you want to postpone knowing anything about each other for as long as possible."," Oh.  I disagree. If there's some potential 'oh' moment, I want to know about it right away. I mean, what's the alternative?"
Barney," You are such a cutie pie. Here's a quarter, go play something on the jukebox."," Yeah, I agree with Ted. In a real relationship, you share everything. That's why Marshall and I don't keep any secrets.  It's true. They tell each other everything."
Barney, I can think of tons of things there's no way Marshall told you, It's true. They tell each other everything.  Try me.
Barney, Do you know about the time the Marshall was in Trenton?, Try me.  Doggie ate his pants. Yep.
Barney, Bill's bachelor party in Memphis.," Doggie ate his pants. Yep.  Oh, when they had to pump out all the nickels from his stomach?"
Barney," OK, Seattle."," Oh, when they had to pump out all the nickels from his stomach?  Trick question, Marshall's never been to the Pacific Northwest because he's afraid of Sasquatch."
Barney, Damn.," Trick question, Marshall's never been to the Pacific Northwest because he's afraid of Sasquatch.  I'm not afraid of Sasquatch. I just think we should all be on alert."
Barney," Fine, do you want to know what Robin's secret is?"," Yeah, meanwhile, Robin tells me nothing.  You know?"
Barney," Of course I know. She couldn't look at us. Her face got flushed. That's shame. Our friend, Robin, used to do p*rn, wait for it, ography."," You know?  Yeah, we didn't really have to wait for that. And it's ridiculous."
Barney, They speak French there too? God! That place is a mess.," My friend in Canada who got married way too young, they had to do their vows twice, once in French.  So, you don't think there's any friend from Canada?"
Barney," Guys, there's not way Robin's married. It's ludicrous to even suggest it."," Oh, I'm sure there is. Just like I have a friend who wet his bed till he was ten. Use your brain, Ted.  Thank you Barney."
Barney, 'Cause it's p*rn., Thank you Barney.  I need another beer.
Barney," 20,000 says it's p*rn."," Robin is not in p*rn. I'll bet you anything that she's married.  I don't have 20,000."
Barney," Well then, what do you have?"," I don't have 20,000.  Well."
Barney, I got it. The ultimate wager. Slap bet.," No.  Oh, slap bet. We used to do those when I was a kid."
Barney, Your hand is monstrous.," OK.INT. MACLAREN'S  Well, what did you expect? You've seen my penis."
Barney, I'm pretty sure we're gonna call is mistress.," See, that's just it. I'm not the boyfriend, I'm the mistress. No, not the mistress. The mastress. Master. What do you call it?  What am I gonna do? My girlfriend's married. Do I ask her to get a divorce?"
Barney," Don't get too cocky, Slappy. I just got a shipment of p*rn from Canada I have to go through.", I can see my hand print on your face.  I won the bet. Why are you still searching?
Barney, Just because you were right doesn't mean I'm wrong.," I won the bet. Why are you still searching?  Oh, right, like you need an excuse to watch p*rn."
Barney," Canadian p*rn. Trust me when I tell you their universal health care system doesn't cover breast implants. If I have to sit through one more flat-chested Nova Scotian riding a Mountie on the back of a Zamboni, I'll go oat of my mind."," Oh, right, like you need an excuse to watch p*rn.  Hey."
Barney," You, you got something to say to me?", He moved there for business.  What are you talking about? Barney: I know Robin was never really married.
Barney, Don't count on it. I've been practicing on a tree trunk.," You told him? Lily: I had to. I'm Slap Bet Commissioner. Baby, this hurts me more than it's gonna hurt you.  Barney gets three slaps."
Barney, Oh my God. Are you gonna cry? Marshall: No. You're gonna cry., One because you lied. And two for being prematurely slapped. Three slaps.  I just don't think it's healthy to keep big secrets in a relationship. My parents didn't really talk to each other for thirty years and now they're divorced.
Barney, So I just got a very interesting phone call.," I have shared more of myself with you than I have ever shared with anyone. I'm asking for this one secret, which has nothing to do with us, to just be mine.  What are you talking about?"
Barney, I know Robin's secret., What are you talking about?  What?
Barney," That's right, I know your secret, Robin. Or should I say Robin Sparkles? Robin: How do you know that name? Barney: 'Cause I know the truth. And I am about to show it to you right now."," What?  Gather around, Ted, you're gonna wanna see this."
Barney," Gather around, Ted, you're gonna wanna see this."," That's right, I know your secret, Robin. Or should I say Robin Sparkles? Robin: How do you know that name? Barney: 'Cause I know the truth. And I am about to show it to you right now.  Yeah. No I don't."
Barney, What?, Yeah. No I don't.  Robin wants to keep this a secret so it's gonna stay a secret.
Barney," Yeah, it's not gonna stay a secret. You see, in my research, I came upon a certain gentleman in Malaysia who is in possession of a certain video tape. He just emailed me that it will be up and running on MySpace in about, right now!"," Robin wants to keep this a secret so it's gonna stay a secret.  Robin's world is about to be turned upside-down. I mean, I'm guessing."
Barney," Robin's world is about to be turned upside-down. I mean, I'm guessing."," Yeah, it's not gonna stay a secret. You see, in my research, I came upon a certain gentleman in Malaysia who is in possession of a certain video tape. He just emailed me that it will be up and running on MySpace in about, right now!  Barney, don't, okay."
Barney," Robin, please don't panic. I'm only going to show enough to prove to Marshall that I was right."," Barney, don't, okay.  No, Barney, I said we're not watching this."
Barney, Yeah you were., I wanna stress that I was young.  And I didn't know any better.
Barney, They never do., And I didn't know any better.  And it started out as an innocent modeling job.
Barney, It always does.," And it started out as an innocent modeling job.  Please, Mr. Johnson, I'm sorry I was a bad girl. Please don't give me detention. Isn't there something I can do to make it up to you?"
Barney," Well, obviously, I've been proven right, so in the interest of Robin's dignity, I won't show anymore. Plus, it's getting late. It's already slap o'clock.", Oh my God.  What the hell was that?
Barney, I'm gonna go with the five for eternity.," Yeah, but the constant fear of knowing that at any moment you can get slapped in the face would drive you crazy.  Good call."
Barney," Wow, we're gonna watch this a lot. Robin: I even wore a bedazzled jean jacket."," So, just to be clear, you wanted everybody to go to the mall today?  Hey, just so you know, 16-year-old me would have been all over you. You could have been the girlfriend in Canada I told everyone I had. Hey, I'm really sorry I pried this out of you. I probably should have left it alone."
Barney, Aw.," You know what, you know me better now. That feels kinda nice.  That's one."
Barney, Did you have to laugh like that every time? Robin: Yes.," Everybody come and play. Throw every last care away. Let's go to the mall, today!  There's this boy I like. Met him at the food court. He's got hair like Gretzky and he does jumps on his skateboard. I hope he asks me out. Take me to my favorite spot. It'll be just him and me."
Barney," Okay. All-night rave, abandoned tire factory in Newark. We're on the list. Who's in?"," Kids, there's nothing more wonderful than New York City in the winter... except the view of New York City in the winter through your apartment window.In the winter of 2006, Marshall, Lily, Robin and I were all deep in couple hibernation mode. Sadly, this left Uncle Barney out in the cold.  - Nope."
Barney," Private jet. Teeterboro Airport, skinny-skydiving. Who's in?", - No.  - Nope.
Barney," One beer. Bar, downstairs, 15 second walk. Who's in?"," - No, thanks.  Shh... Lily went sleepy-bye."
Barney,Hi. Have you met me?," It got so bad, Barney tried to be his own wingman.  Finally, he decided to bring in reinforcements."
Barney," Yes. And do you know why? Hang on to your bedsores, grandparents from Willy Wonka, because guess who's on his way up to this apartment right now? My... wait for it... brother, James. React.", - No.  - Hey!
Barney," - Yeah. He's the awesome-est, most best looking-est, greatest guy ever.", - You have a brother?  He's exactly like Barney.
Barney, That's what I just said.," He's exactly like Barney.  Well, Barney and his brother aren't exactly alike. James is gay."
Barney, Is gimme five back?," Awesome, as per yoozh. I just went skinny-skydiving. Legendary. And my laser tag team, just made it to regional finals.Legendarier. And by now you've noticed the suit. go 'head, touch it. Handcrafted by Pietro Dellacamera, Milan's famous 101-year-old tailor who upon completing the very last stitch in this suit dropped d*ad, which is ironic because that is how gorgeous I look in it. C'mon. Gimme five.  Oh, yeah. I put it in my blog this morning."
Barney," Guys, gimme five is back!"," Oh, yeah. I put it in my blog this morning.  Oh, James, this is my girlfriend, Robin."
Barney, Please.," So, I have to ask, there's a story here.  The truth is, Barney and James got a lot of... different explanations from their mom over the years."
Barney," I'll tell you what James is gonna do. He's gonna do the job you've been neglecting. And, as always, he'll do it a lot better than you ever did. Ted... James is my wingman now.", So what are you guys gonna do tonight?  Okay.
Barney, It was everything we ever dreamed of when watching Donnie and Marie. She was a little bit country., And then there was the time they scored the brother/sister combo. He was a little bit way into black guys.
Barney," Help, I don't think he's breathing. Does anyone know mouth-to-mouth?"," And Barney always returned the favor.  Oh, my God, I do!"
Barney,"Okay, great. How 'bout you instead?"," Oh, my God, I do!  Oh, man, I am so excited that you're here! It has been forever since I have been around anyone even remotely fun. Uh, yes offense."
Barney," Oh, man, I am so excited that you're here! It has been forever since I have been around anyone even remotely fun. Uh, yes offense.","Okay, great. How 'bout you instead?  You guys are still going out with us tonight, right?"
Barney," Daddy's home! Yeah. All right, bro. What do you like? Guy in super tight black T? Super tight black guy? Guy who looks like Mr. T?"," So that night, Barney got his wish. We all went out.  Mmm, yes, yes, and... talk to me after two martinis. Let's focus on you, my man."
Barney, I'm feeling lazy. How 'bout girl with the chocolatini?," Mmm, yes, yes, and... talk to me after two martinis. Let's focus on you, my man.  Oh... boom, back tattoo. Hero and the pig?"
Barney, -Let's ride.," Oh... boom, back tattoo. Hero and the pig?  -Fo' 'sho. Damn baby, nice tramp stamp!"
Barney," -Hey! Hey! Her body art is not an invitation to grope her, it's an expression of her inner self. I'm sure, in many ways, she is the dolphin encircled by flowers."," - Get off me, you pig!  - What? What?"
Barney, -What? What?, - What? What?  Cool.
Barney, Let me know if he bothers you again., Cool.  Thanks. You should stay close... just in case.
Barney, Sure. If it'll make you feel safer. I'm Barney.," Thanks. You should stay close... just in case.  Now, kids, when you're out at a noisy, crowded bar, you can always tell the difference between the singles and the couples. You just have to look for the signs."
Barney, - Boiling hot., - Break.  Singles stay on their feet for maneuverability.
Barney, Have you met my brother?," - Hey! - Hi, how are ya?  Oh, hello. Have a drink."
Barney," Oh, hello. Have a drink.", Have you met my brother?  Nice to meet ya.
Barney, What's gonna k*ll me? What's going on?, This is gonna k*ll Barney.  B-Barney? Have you noticed anything...different about James?
Barney," No. I mean, he's glowing from his peel, if that's what you mean."," B-Barney? Have you noticed anything...different about James?  We have reason to believe that James is, uh, maybe hiding something from you. I-I know you're not gonna like hearing this, but... Barney... your brother is...monogamous."
Barney," That's ridiculous! Just because he's a little sleepy, and he hasn't had sex with anyone in a bathroom stall... He hasn't had sex with anyone in a bathroom stall."," We have reason to believe that James is, uh, maybe hiding something from you. I-I know you're not gonna like hearing this, but... Barney... your brother is...monogamous.  And, Barney... I hate to be the one to tell you this, but... he's texting."
Barney," No, he... No! That... is impossible. Excuse... Excuse... Ex..."," And, Barney... I hate to be the one to tell you this, but... he's texting.  Hey, bro."
Barney, Don't change the subject. Let me see your phone.," Hey, bro.  Why?"
Barney, I just want to see your phone. Let me see your phone.," Why?  No, it's just a phone. It's just a phone! And it's got Internet access, and it's got a camera on it, and you can surf the Web and do the whole thing. It's so amazing how far technology has come. What kind of phone do you have?"
Barney, I got... Who is this? And the answer better be: I don't remember his name.," No, it's just a phone. It's just a phone! And it's got Internet access, and it's got a camera on it, and you can surf the Web and do the whole thing. It's so amazing how far technology has come. What kind of phone do you have?  That is Tom. And he's my fianc'.James meets Barney at McLaren's"
Barney, I don't support this., Hey.  Gay marriage?
Barney," Not gay marriage-- marriage! How can you do this?We were raised in the same house, with the same values!"," Gay marriage?  Believe me, I fought this for a long time. Come on, it's embarrassing. Look, this felt unnatural to me, too, at first. But I fell in love. And Tom and I realized you can't fight love."
Barney," Oh, God. Is that what you two do together? You sit around the house and talk about love? I think... I'm gonna be sick."," Believe me, I fought this for a long time. Come on, it's embarrassing. Look, this felt unnatural to me, too, at first. But I fell in love. And Tom and I realized you can't fight love.  Okay, okay, look,I need you to wrap your head around this, okay? Because it is happening. And I want you to be my best man."
Barney, What? No way.," Okay, okay, look,I need you to wrap your head around this, okay? Because it is happening. And I want you to be my best man.  Well, I'm sorry you feel that way. I hope you change your mind."
Barney," Oh, it's a freaking epidemic."," Two beers, one sh*t.  Oh, sweetie! Did you make that for me?"
Barney," Clam Bake. Staten Island. Who's in? Okay, I didn't have high hopes for that one. Okay, here's my thing. If gay guys start getting married, then suddenly the whole world's gonna be doing it. That's how it works. They start something, then six months later, everyone follows. Like now everyone gets manicures.", Yes.  I don't get manicures.
Barney," Okay, then like how... Like getting your chest waxed.", I don't get manicures.  You get your chest waxed?
Barney," You know what I mean! Gay marriage is going to cause single life, as we know it, to die out. Think of how the American family will be strengthened."," You get your chest waxed?  Barney, I'm sorry you're upset, but you got to suck it up and be a man about this."
Barney," No. It's always been me and him together, being awesome, while the rest of you walked two-by-two onto your ark of sexless boredom."," Barney, I'm sorry you're upset, but you got to suck it up and be a man about this.  Just because James is getting married doesn't mean things are going to change."
Barney, Yeah. Like things haven't changed with you people.," Just because James is getting married doesn't mean things are going to change.  Look, my sister married a guy I didn't like. Sandals and socks--come on, buddy. But I took her out, we celebrated. It was the right thing to do. You got to support him."
Barney," You're right, Ted. This is a cause for celebration. We need to take him out and celebrate the commitment he and Tom are about to make."," Look, my sister married a guy I didn't like. Sandals and socks--come on, buddy. But I took her out, we celebrated. It was the right thing to do. You got to support him.  Yeah. This is where we're celebrating the commitment that Tom and I are about to make?"
Barney," What? Yeah! See, that cage represents your commitment."," Yeah. This is where we're celebrating the commitment that Tom and I are about to make?  Oh, my God. Freedom has never tasted so delicious."
Barney, Sounds like you really rocked that arts and crafts fair.,"And then Tom says to the dealer that the handmade Georgian clock has a chip on the corner. Blam, we get that puppy half price. What up?! Bam!  Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Hey, oh, my God. This is so liberating, being able to talk about this to you. I cannot wait for you to meet Tom."
Barney," And I cannot wait for you to meet my good friend... this guy. Excuse me, do you know anyone who would like to buy my incredibly muscular, fun, large-handed brother a drink?"," Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Hey, oh, my God. This is so liberating, being able to talk about this to you. I cannot wait for you to meet Tom.  Eh, eh, eh, let's focus on you, Barnaby. Okay. All right. I spy a group of women who have let their defenses down because they are in a gay club. You see that chick right there? She looks like she'd fall for sports agent and football player."
Barney," Okay, I'm in. Which one am I?"," Eh, eh, eh, let's focus on you, Barnaby. Okay. All right. I spy a group of women who have let their defenses down because they are in a gay club. You see that chick right there? She looks like she'd fall for sports agent and football player.  Please."
Barney," He's very shy, loves tennis and Brazil, and drops his pants after three dirty martinis. Now go, man, go!", Please.  I just never thought I'd see Barney so vulnerable.
Barney," James, James, since you like arts and crafts, look at what Charles here made with cherry stems. He did it with his tongue. Yeah."," Oh, totally. Let's go find a sports bar.  Barney."
Barney," So, Charles, why don't you put your number in my brother's phone, and once he's in a funner mood..."," Barney.  Barney, Barney, I don't want his number. I don't want anyone's number, okay? I'm getting married."
Barney," Oh, so now it's my way of life? I thought it was our way of life. You've completely turned your back on it. Look at you, not even suited up. Do you remember why we suit up, James?"," Okay, okay, excuse me. Barney, family talk. Okay, dude, you have got to stop this, okay? I know that my getting married is thr*at to your way of life...  To get laid."
Barney," To show people that we are different from the millions of T-shirt and jeans lemmings out there. The suit shows that we are a force to be reckoned with, a two-person army that plays by its own rules. But you've taken off the uniform, you've crossed enemy lines, and you've abandoned me. Well, I'm not gonna let you do that. It's not too late to back out of this stupid marriage thing! You don't have to do this, bro!"," To get laid.  - Yes, I do."
Barney, - Why?!," - Yes, I do.  Because Tom and I are gonna have a baby."
Barney, What? There's gonna be a baby?, Because Tom and I are gonna have a baby.  Yes. We're adopting.
Barney," Oh, my God. I'm gonna be an uncle?", Yes. We're adopting.  For the rest of your life.
Barney, To James and Tom. May you have a long and happy life together. And may I always have the skin and libido of a much younger man.- Cheers., For the rest of your life.  - Cheers.
Barney, Thanks. I decided to leave out the hetero college phase. No one wants to, - Cheers.  It was perfect. You even made Tom's dad cry. Might have been doing that because he's a Republican.
Barney," Ugh, it's a freaking epidemic."," Oh, stop calling me that. It makes me sound fat.  - May I?"
Barney, - May I?," Ugh, it's a freaking epidemic.  - Yeah."
Barney," Hey, buddy. Your parents are married. Now, listen, you. Just because you're being raised by married people doesn't mean you have to choose that lifestyle. High-five. Luckily, you got me. In 20 and a half years, you'll be 21, and I will be... Well, I haven't decided how old I'll be yet. But we are gonna bro out, uncle and nephew style. Stick with me, kid. I am gonna teach you how to live. Great suit, by the way. Who is the cutest?", - Yeah.  I don't get it. Tom liked my breasts in tenth grade. Why doesn't he like them now? Why?
Barney," Rosa, why always be attracted to the unavailable ones? Why not accept the fact that you're a beautiful woman who is worthy of love? Are you brave enough to hear that? You...", I don't get it. Tom liked my breasts in tenth grade. Why doesn't he like them now? Why?
Barney," She'd give it up for a bad pun. I'm telling you, she's a laugh slut."," Yeah. No, you're right. Lily would laugh at anything.  Remember that time we heard her laughing and we thought she was watching Weekend At Bernie's, but it turned out she was watching Weekend At Bernie's 2?"
Barney," And her art? I'm Lily, I'm an artist. She doesn't even own a beret."," Remember that time we heard her laughing and we thought she was watching Weekend At Bernie's, but it turned out she was watching Weekend At Bernie's 2?  Yeah, and if she's such a great artist, why does she suck at Pictionary? Who draws a ninja star like a Star of David? Right, right?"
Barney, Then why don't you say it now?," Why is this such a big deal? It's just a word. We use lots of words, every day. It shouldn't be any different than any other word.  Grinch. You timed that didn't you?"
Barney, Perfectly.," Grinch. You timed that didn't you?  Well, at least you apologized. You apologized, didn't you?"
Barney, Ted Vivian Mosby!," Oh, you'll be sorry, Ted Mosby.  That's not my middle name."
Barney, Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?, That's not my middle name.  Like you've never said that word.
Barney, I don't kiss your mother with my mouth. Yet. (Barney sneezes), Like you've never said that word.  Are you sick?
Barney, Is it sick to find maturity and experience sexy?," Are you sick?  No, I meant do you have a cold?"
Barney," I'm fine. I'm fine. My nose is just overflowing with awesome and I had to get some of it out. Now, if you'll excuse me, the holidays are a time when people are lonely and desperate. It's the most wonderful time of the year."," No, I meant do you have a cold?  I should go apologize. It's Christmas Eve."
Barney," I don't see any mistletoe, but... (He sneezes on her)"," Yeah. I mean, slamming doors and screaming curses? If I wanted that, I would have gone home for the holidays.  Oh! Oh, God!"
Barney, Uh... Bless you would have been nice.," Oh! Oh, God!  You're sick."
Barney, I'm not sick., You're sick.  You're sick.
Barney, You know what? I am sick. Sick of you telling me I'm sick. What up?," You're sick.  Ahh... Three flights of stairs, not a drop spilled. Hey, buddy."
Barney," Hey, blame Lily and her oppressive no cigars in the apartment rule. God, it's like Marshall's marrying the Taliban.(he sneezes on his hand).High five."," Barney! What the hell are you doing? Get in here, it's freezing outside. Are you insane?  Eww. No. You have to go home and get to bed."
Barney," Oh, Robin, my simple friend from the untamed north, let me tell you about a little thing I like to call mind over body. You see, whenever I start feeling sick, I just stop being sick and be awesome instead. True story. Yeah, in two minutes, I'm going to pound a sixer of Red Bull, hop in a cab, play a couple of hours of laser tag, maybe get a spray-on tan. It's gonna be legen... Wait for it...(Barney falls asleep)", Eww. No. You have to go home and get to bed.  Lily!
Barney,...dary.," Marshall gets home in three hours. He's gonna show up--no Lily, no winter wonderland.I gotta get up to the Bronx.  Hey, dude, how's the paper going?"
Barney," This is a low moment for the Barnacle. I should be off playing laser tag right now, but instead... Don't look at me. I'm hideous."," Hey, hey, no, no, no. Ted, Ted. You don't know this yet, but you and I are going to be great friends. Now, the Native Americans have this ritual...  You just look like a regular guy."
Barney, Exactly. I'm a Ted. I'm wearing elastic-waist fleece pants., You just look like a regular guy.  And isn't it more comfy?
Barney, Yes.," And isn't it more comfy?  Come on, you need eat something."
Barney, Too weak... to hold... bowl.," Come on, you need eat something.  Fine, I'll feed you."
Barney, Ouchie in my mouth! I don't want it. I want ice cream.," Fine, I'll feed you.  No, you're not having ice cream for dinner just 'cause you're sick."
Barney, But my throat hurts.," No, you're not having ice cream for dinner just 'cause you're sick.  No!"
Barney, I hate you!, No!  Don't leave me.
Barney, Don't leave me., I hate you!  Who is this?
Barney, I left something in the hallway., Spider! Spider!  Where?
Barney," Watch your steps when you get up, kids, 'cause I am about to drop some knowledge. Relationships are like a freeway."," Don't tell me you're actually buying into Barney's freeway theory.  Wait a minute, a month ago you told me relationships are like a traveling circus."
Barney," No, this is new. This trumps that. Freeways have exits. So do relationships. The first exit, my personal favorite, is six hours in. You meet, you talk, you have sex, you exit when she's in the shower."," Wait a minute, a month ago you told me relationships are like a traveling circus.  So every girl you have sex with feels the immediate need to shower? Actually, yeah, I get that."
Barney," The next exits are four days, three weeks, seven months--that's when you guys are gonna break up, mark your calendars."," So every girl you have sex with feels the immediate need to shower? Actually, yeah, I get that.  What?"
Barney," Then a year and a half,' years, and the last exit-- death. Which, if you've been with the same woman for your entire life, it's like, Are we there yet?"," What?  So I've never been on the freeway this long before. I mean, usually by now I find out the guy has some weird personality thing that makes me want to take the next exit."
Barney, Discouraging premarital sex is against my religion.," Yeah, I don't have any of those.  Please? I'm her older sister. I'm supposed to teach her how to make good and responsible decisions."
Barney,Sex is fun., Totally. You should wait.  See?
Barney," I'll pay you $10,000 for that diary."," Well, how do you know that? You left your diary in your old room slash my new room.  Look, I've been dating Kyle for two months now. It's like forever. I mean, we've already done everything else. I mean, we've even..."
Barney," Good one, Ted. I was, uh, six... fourt... How old were you again?", Barney was probably 12.  17.
Barney," Dude, me, too."," 17.  Barney, you okay?"
Barney," Yeah, of course. What, you don't believe me? - It was at camp, so I'm..."," Barney, you okay?  What camp?"
Barney, This place in the Catskills. Look it up. I was there teaching for the summer., What camp?  What did you teach?
Barney," Uh, dance.", What did you teach?  Dance?
Barney," Yeah, Ted, dance. Maybe you've heard of it. It was just a simple summer job, but it turned into so much more. Her name was Frances Houseman, but everyone called her Baby.", Dance?  Sylvia
Barney, Sylvia," Yeah, Ted, dance. Maybe you've heard of it. It was just a simple summer job, but it turned into so much more. Her name was Frances Houseman, but everyone called her Baby.  Yes, Mickey?"
Barney, How you call your loverboy?," Yes, Mickey?  Come here, loverboy"
Barney, And if he doesn't answer," Come here, loverboy  Oh, loverboy"
Barney, And if he still doesn't answer?," Oh, loverboy  I simply say, baby... Oh, baby. My sweet baby"
Barney," Ooh, why, Lily Aldrin, you saucy little harlot. Could it be that before Marshall took a swim, someone else tested the water?"," No, it doesn't. It doesn't count. End of story.  No. Nobody else tested the water, right? Scooter?"
Barney, Who's Scooter?," No. Nobody else tested the water, right? Scooter?  My high school boyfriend, who I did not have sex with."
Barney," No, Marshall, they say,(with a sad voice)Oh, look at them, they've only had sex with each other."," I... I can't believe this. We're Marshall and Lily, when people see us, they say, Oh, look at them, they've only had sex with each other.  But now that's not true anymore, now you've had sex with twice as many people as I have. I knew that you were too good at it."
Barney, What are you talking about? We were here yesterday.," I am so glad we're finally doing this.  Yeah, but that didn't really count. Oh, crap."
Barney, They've only had sex with each other.," We've only had sex with each other.  Ooh, okay, in, in we go, in we go. Okay, Empire State Building fun fact number 81: There are 1,860 steps from this...(They push him outside the elevator)Whoa, whoa! Come on!"
Barney," Okay. I was 16, and it was in a baseball dugout..."," That's right, I almost forgot.  Fast Times at Ridgemont High."
Barney," I mean, I was in a subway with a high-priced call girl...", Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  Risky Business.
Barney, I was accidentally hacking into NORAD'S computer...," Risky Business.  That's w*r Games, and there's not even a sex scene in it."
Barney," All right! I was 23, and it was with my mom's 45-year-old divorced friend, Rhonda. She called me Barry the whole time, and for two weeks, my comforter smelled like menthol cigarettes. You happy?"," That's w*r Games, and there's not even a sex scene in it.  Hey... Why don't you tell us again about your first time at the camp in the Catskills."
Barney, Baby and her family spent every summer at Kellerman's. Her dad did not approve of our love., Hey... Why don't you tell us again about your first time at the camp in the Catskills.  Did anyone put Baby in a corner?
Barney," Oh, God, no. What can I say, I... had... the time of my life. True story.", Did anyone put Baby in a corner?
Barney, I have found that to be true.," Well, 'cause only good-looking people can get away with saying things like that.  It's a blessing and a curse really."
Barney, Mona., Angela.  Mona?
Barney, Watch it more closely. Rock your world.," Mona?  So, what are you gonna do?"
Barney, You mind if I charge my phone?," Fine, Mosby can stay. But tell him he's on thin ice. Come here. I like you, Crosby.  Knock yourself out."
Barney," Oh, my God!(barney's holding a painting)", You know what? I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna f*re Druthers tomorrow.  What?
Barney, Do you know about this?, What?  No.
Barney," Only the greatest thing ever. Wait, wait, wait-- that's not enough buildup. If they were to cure cancer tomorrow, this would still be the greatest thing to happen all week. Okay. Now you're ready for naked Marshall."," What is that?  Oh, my God. This is awesome times awesome. It's awesome squared."
Barney," I know, right? Behind the piano this whole time."," Oh, my God. This is awesome times awesome. It's awesome squared.  Wait. If Marshall went to all this trouble to hide it, he clearly doesn't want us to find it."
Barney," Oh, come on, Robin."," Wait. If Marshall went to all this trouble to hide it, he clearly doesn't want us to find it.  No, I'm saying that he must be really embarrassed by this. We are gonna have so much fun."
Barney, I know! We're gonna have so much fun!," No, I'm saying that he must be really embarrassed by this. We are gonna have so much fun.  Oh, sorry I'm late; lunch ran a little long. You wanted to see me, Mosby?"
Barney," Oh, hey, Marshall. Have a seat. I know how much you love stools."," I can't f*re a guy on his birthday. Everyone would hate me. Besides, they put a party hat on me. My authority was compromised.  Thanks. Yeah, stools are better for your posture."
Barney," Hey, guys. Guess what I got. A new dart."," Thank you. That's so sweet. You guys are being... so sweet.  Oh, wow, a new dart."
Barney," Oh, yes, Robin, I just love new dart. Nude art."," I did not know you were such a fan of new dart, Barney. Nude art."
Barney, We totally saw your butt., We're not in high school anymore. People don't make fun of you for posing nude for a painting. We're adults now.  This painting has caused too much grief already. I'm destroying it right now.
Barney," Oh, no, what's the matter, Marshall?", This painting has caused too much grief already. I'm destroying it right now.  Where is it?
Barney, I'll tell you where it is if you'll answer these riddles three.," Where is it?  You hung it up in the bar, didn't you?"
Barney," Yo, why you gotta ruin my riddles?"," You hung it up in the bar, didn't you?  Field trip!"
Barney," Oh, no. Someone put your painting up behind the bar. Classic! What a memorable prank."," Field trip!  Hey, Marshall. What'll you have?"
Barney," Easy, Scherbatsky. Finesse. I've got a five-year rollout plan. I'll have you know that painting's got commitments all over the city. Then, after New York..."," Okay, where should we put it up next? In his law school? Ooh on the side of a bus. Oh, oh! How much do billboards cost?  Oneof my worst fears has come true-- I just saw Marshall grabbing himself naked. Well, I gotta go. Believe it or not, I have to go back to the office."
Barney," Eh, we're not making fun of the painting, we're just making fun of Marshall. The painting's actually really great."," You know, I wish everyone didn't have to make fun of that painting.  Are you serious?"
Barney, Yeah.," Are you serious?  Well, thank you. You know, seeing it again makes me miss painting nudes. What?"
Barney, Paint me.," Well, thank you. You know, seeing it again makes me miss painting nudes. What?  What?"
Barney, Paint me., What?  Who's that? Who's out there?
Barney, Paint me.," Maybe we can.  Okay, I don't get this. You've been making fun of that painting all this time and now you want me to paint you?"
Barney," We knew we could t*rture Marshall because he has shame. I do not. In my body, where the shame gland should be, there's a second awesome gland. True story."," Okay, I don't get this. You've been making fun of that painting all this time and now you want me to paint you?  Yeah, that's not the gland I'm worried about painting."
Barney," Yeah. A nude Barney is a challenge. But I think you're talented enough to immortalize this. Now is the time-- I'm 31. I'm at the peak of my physical beauty. If I were a woman, I'd have passed it long, long ago. Long ago."," Yeah, that's not the gland I'm worried about painting.  Forget it. I promised Marshall he was the only guy I would ever see naked."
Barney," I'll give you $5,000.", Forget it. I promised Marshall he was the only guy I would ever see naked.  We're going to Loch Ness!
Barney," Hey, hey! I don't want you phoning this in. This painting could, someday, become a serious work of art. I mean, you have been blessed with an amazing gift."," Okay, let's get this over with.  Thank you."
Barney," I meant me. Now, I like how you captured Marshall's essence. Goofy and unburdened, with wit. But me, I want something more regal. Something my progeny could look at and say, There's stands Barnabus Stinson. He was wise... and strong.", Thank you.  I don't think your sword will fit.
Barney, I get that a lot.," I don't think your sword will fit.  And so, as Lily began painting, Marshall thought about the $5,000 and what his fiancee was doing to earn it."
Barney, Paint faster!," Hold still. Hold still. Hold still!  Okay, I guess it's time. Drop your shorts."
Barney," Yeah. Wait, wait! That wasn't enough buildup. I need... In a world without justice, one man..."," Okay, I guess it's time. Drop your shorts.  Oh, just drop them!"
Barney, All right.," Oh, just drop them!  No! No, this is not right!"
Barney, We had a deal!," No! No, this is not right!  Well, I'm going back on the deal. Barney, get out!"
Barney, You...!," Well, I'm going back on the deal. Barney, get out!  It's over!(he closes the door at Barney's face).(Yelling)Lily, I can't let you go through with this!(whispering)I found a castle we can stay in, but it's an extra two grand.(Yelling)It's just not right!(whispering). It's beautiful and they say it's haunted."
Barney," Before you say anything, I'll give you an extra five grand."," It's over!(he closes the door at Barney's face).(Yelling)Lily, I can't let you go through with this!(whispering)I found a castle we can stay in, but it's an extra two grand.(Yelling)It's just not right!(whispering). It's beautiful and they say it's haunted. We accept."
Barney," You people are so easy to control. Dance for me, puppets, dance.",We accept.  And that's how Uncle Barney paid for Lily and Marshall's honeymoon.
Barney," Thank you very much, Lily."," Okay, it's done. I'm gonna step out, so you can admire it.  Marshall, do you have the money?"
Barney, A smooth area?! You gave me the Ken doll?!Marshall and Lily get out of the apartment.She left out Little Barney. Barnacle Junior. My Barnana is... Barnito Supreme., Let's get out of here!
Barney," Problem. Oh, poor Superman, he should really do something about his flying problem. It's not a problem if you're awesome at it."," Marshall, you're on beer detail. Lily, you're making the bean dip. Uh, Robin, you're on chips and pretzels, and Barney, I'm giving you nothing to do so you can just focus on controlling your gambling problem.  And I will be going to Quinn's to pick up the world's greatest food, the Super Bowl Hot Wings Platter."
Barney, Not a clue.," No idea.  Well, I guess we should go, right?"
Barney," Seriously, that's the last time I'm gonna call you today. Okay. Good-bye. You didn't hang up either! I know! You hang up! You hang up! My bookie. Great guy."," Oh, my God. This monkey was so cute.  So let me get this straight. A funeral is the one time you don't suit up?"
Barney," Have I taught you nothing, Ted?", So let me get this straight. A funeral is the one time you don't suit up?  Virtually.
Barney, Suits are full of joy. They're the sartorial equivalent of a baby's smile., Virtually.  Sartorial?
Barney," Of or pertaining to tailors or their trade. Suits are for the living. That's why when it's my time to R.I.P. I'm going out of this world the same way I came into it buck naked. Yeah. It's gonna be awesome. Open bar for the guys, open casket for the ladies. What up?!", Sartorial?  Such a waste.
Barney, Such a waste.," Of or pertaining to tailors or their trade. Suits are for the living. That's why when it's my time to R.I.P. I'm going out of this world the same way I came into it buck naked. Yeah. It's gonna be awesome. Open bar for the guys, open casket for the ladies. What up?!  I know. He was so young."
Barney," A hand-stitched, cashmere, double-breasted Dolce & Gabbana. It must be so frightened."," I know. He was so young.  This is going faster than I thought. We'll make an appearance at the bar for the wake, we'll be watching the game by 8:00."
Barney," Oh, thank God! I'll find out."," Oh, let's face it, we're not going to get to watch it. We should just find out the score.  No, no, no, we can't! We have to watch the game together. It's tradition. Think of all the great times we've had watching this game."
Barney," Ted, it's not a drinking game if you drink anytime anything happens."," Second down, everyone drink.  Are these chicken wings or angel wings? God, I love these things."
Barney, I don't bet. Betting's for suckers.," Hey, Barney, I bet you 20 bucks that Casey misses this field goal.  Make it like a dollar or something, you know. Who cares? No big deal."
Barney, Fine.," Make it like a dollar or something, you know. Who cares? No big deal.  See, there you go, he made it. You win."
Barney," Wait. This is mine, just like that? God, that feels good. No, that feels really... good. What else can we bet on?"," See, there you go, he made it. You win.  Nothing, it's the halftime show."
Barney," Yeah, yeah, whatever. I'll give you the Seahawks plus six points for 500 bucks.", I can't believe you invited this girl we've only known for a few months to our sacred day. Now she's gonna be in all the pictures.  Are you crazy? Maybe for $50.
Barney," $50?! What fun is $50?! Why don't we just bet air?! God, Marshall! Okay, $50."," Are you crazy? Maybe for $50.  Hey, I'll take that action. Seahawks, but make it four points and make it a grand. Hey, these wings, are they chicken wings or angel wings? Oh, commercials! Monkey with a coconut bra. Hilarious."
Barney, That's impossible.," Look, we always watch the Super Bowl together. So we make a pact to watch it tomorrow at 6:00 and go the next' hours without finding out who won.  I'm not gonna lie to you. It's not gonna be easy. That means no TV, no Internet, no newspapers, nothing. Media blackout. But our tradition lives on. Who's in?"
Barney," What the hell, I'm in. High five!"," I'm in.  Dude, we're at a wake."
Barney, Sorry. Solemn low five.," Dude, we're at a wake.  As the day began, none of us had any idea how hard it would be to go nine hours without hearing the outcome of the Super Bowl. I decided to work from home to avoid contamination by the outside world."
Barney," Hey, take this key and swallow it."," As the day began, none of us had any idea how hard it would be to go nine hours without hearing the outcome of the Super Bowl. I decided to work from home to avoid contamination by the outside world.  What? No."
Barney," Come on, Ted, you eat salads. It'll be out by game time."," What? No.  Lots more, no."
Barney," I'm not messing around, Theodore. I've got a lot of money riding on this game. If I don't handcuff myself to this radiator, I'll check the score. Please take the key."," Lots more, no.  Fine. But only because you didn't think through a bathroom plan and I think that's funny."
Barney," Unlock me, Ted. I've never gone this long without calling my bookie. He worries.", Just went up to eight.Ted's place. Barney's still tied up to the radiator.  Not until game time.
Barney, Where are you going?, Not until game time.  Pick up the hot wings.
Barney, What? How the hell are you planning on getting in and out of a sports bar without seeing the score? There's TVs everywhere.," Pick up the hot wings.  Ah, don't worry. I got it all planned out. First of all: I placed duct tape on a pair of sunglasses so I can only see out of two tiny holes. Next, I constructed blinders out of an old cereal box. Top it all off: high-tech noise-reducing headphones I bought when Marshall and Lily first got back together and were doing it a lot. I call it the Sensory Deprivator 5000."
Barney," Sir, who won the Super Bowl?", I want my money back. And your pudding snack pack.  Sorry. I missed the game.
Barney, You missed...?! How could he miss...? Excuse me! Who won the Super Bowl?!, Sorry. I missed the game.  I... don't really follow sports.
Barney," Oh, my...! Emmitt Smith! Oh, thank God."," I... don't really follow sports.  Yeah, I get that a lot."
Barney," You got to tell me, who won the Super Bowl?"," Yeah, I get that a lot.  The game was last night? You know, once you win two or three of those things, it's kind of like, eh."
Barney," But you're Emmitt Smith. You're a football player, it's Super Bowl Sunday. What could possibly be more important than football?!"," The game was last night? You know, once you win two or three of those things, it's kind of like, eh.  Dance, my friend. Dance."
Barney, No...!," Dance, my friend. Dance.  Hello! It's me again."
Barney, No...!, No...!  Yes...!
Barney, I met Emmitt Smith today.," I almost got fired today.  Ooh, you go first."
Barney," Well, I was frantically running down the street trying to find out the score to the game..."," Yeah, go ahead, Barney.  And here's the funny part, as unforgettable as that Super Bowl was, here it is 23 years later and I don't remember who won... Hell, I don't even remember who played. What I do remember is that we drank beer, we ate wings and we watched the Super Bowl together. Because sometimes, even if you know how something's going to end, that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the ride. We even raised a toast to good old Mike. I mean Mark. Matt. Crap! Why do I keep doing that?"
Barney," I didn't only lose the game, I lost every single prop bet. Total penalty yardage, number of replay-challenges, coin toss... What are the odds of losing the coin toss?"," And here's the funny part, as unforgettable as that Super Bowl was, here it is 23 years later and I don't remember who won... Hell, I don't even remember who played. What I do remember is that we drank beer, we ate wings and we watched the Super Bowl together. Because sometimes, even if you know how something's going to end, that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the ride. We even raised a toast to good old Mike. I mean Mark. Matt. Crap! Why do I keep doing that?  50-50, give or take."
Barney," Interceptions, field-goals, total sacks, whether or not there'd be a safety, first..."," 50-50, give or take."
Barney, Training for a marathon.," Yeah. It sucks, all that work I put in training for the marathon was a total waste.  What?"
Barney, You don't need to train for a marathon. You just run it.," What?  You're kidding, right?"
Barney, Not at all. I could run a marathon anytime I wanted to.," You're kidding, right?  So like tomorrow, you think you could wake up, roll out of bed, and just run the New York City Marathon?"
Barney, Absolutely.," So like tomorrow, you think you could wake up, roll out of bed, and just run the New York City Marathon?  Barney, we're talking about 42 kilometers."
Barney," Here's how you run a marathon. Step one, you start running. There is no step two."," Thanks, Canada. I'll take it from here. Barney, it's like 26 miles. "
Barney," 50 bucks? Gee, Grandpa, if I win, maybe I can buy myself an ice-cream cone. Make it $10,000.",  You have a gambling problem. You'll bet me 50.
Barney," Fine, then no bet. Okay, $50."," You have a gambling problem. You'll bet me 50.  The next morning, as the marathon began, we were focused on Marshall's computer."
Barney," What up, non-finishers?"," Hey! That's mine. Yeah, you'd better run!  Wow. Very impressive, Barney."
Barney," Right? Yeah, my time would have been like a half an hour better, but I met this total hottie on Mile Seven. We took a quick detour and had our own mini marathon behind a Nathan's. I won."," Wow. Very impressive, Barney.  I'm not sure anyone in that story is a winner."
Barney, So where's my 50 bucks?," I'm not sure anyone in that story is a winner.  All right. I got to admit, you earned this."
Barney," Huh? Can't believe they haven't made a coin for this yet. Anyway, I'm heading home. Might go h*t the gym."," All right. I got to admit, you earned this.  Oh, hey, just so you know, uh, all marathon runners get to use the subway for free today."
Barney, Wow. You know I really should check out this subway. Heard so much about it. Wow. Look at me. Slumming it. Maybe I'll make a weekend out of it and I'll call my bridge and tunnel girl tonight.," Oh, hey, just so you know, uh, all marathon runners get to use the subway for free today.  You're dating a girl from New Jersey?"
Barney, No., You're dating a girl from New Jersey?  So Barney did it. He actually finished the marathon. But a little while later... I got an interesting phone call.
Barney," Ted, it's Barney. Listen to me, I need you to come and pick me up on the subway."," Hello?  What, what are you talking about?"
Barney," I was sitting here, totally minding my own business."," What, what are you talking about?  Finisher. Yeah, you know what I mean."
Barney," Finisher. Yeah, you know what I mean."," I was sitting here, totally minding my own business.  86th street."
Barney," My legs don't work. I've already ridden the subway twice end to end. I've seen where it turns around. Ted, you don't ever want to see where the subway turns around.", 86th street. (to Marshall)Barney's legs won't work. He's riding the subway from end to end because he physically can't get off the train.
Barney," Listen to me, Ted. I'm going to lose you any second. I'm on the fourth car of the six train heading south from Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx. Meet me at the 86th Street station in, like, half an hour?", Best 50 bucks I ever spent.  All right. I'll be right there. Stay where you are.
Barney," Ted, Ted."," All right. I'll be right there. Stay where you are.  Oh, come on. You're not even going to give up your seat for him?"
Barney, I'm sorry. I can't.," Oh, come on. You're not even going to give up your seat for him?  Douche."
Barney, Ted!, Barney?!  Hey!
Barney, No...!," Hey!  See? If Barney never tried to run the marathon, you never would have jumped that turnstile, you wouldn't have had that court date today, and we would have made this flight."
Barney,I can't go. I've got this thing.," You don't understand. This is an amazing sale. I've heard about it before, but I never knew where it was. We'll have a wedding dress campout. It'll be fun.  What thing?"
Barney, A penis., What thing?  This is the place.
Barney, I don't know. Is she fat?," Okay, so you have to have sex with one. Either classic mermaid; bottom half fish, top half human, or inverted mermaid, top half fish, bottom half human. Go!  Yeah, but it's a fish, so it's the good kind of fat."
Barney, I-I don't take flyers., Hot off the presses!  You took one two seconds before you walked in here.
Barney, That's different. It was for a strip club. Two bucks off wings. How much is your flyer going to save me on wings?, You took one two seconds before you walked in here.  Fine. It's a flyer from my play.
Barney," Oh, Lily, I'd love to, but we're not in college and I'm not trying to sleep with you. So anyway, this mermaid..."," Fine. It's a flyer from my play.  Hey, Lily's friend asked her to be in this play, and it's gonna be really good."
Barney," Lily, I love you, but we're too old for this. Asking someone to come see your play is like asking someone for a ride to the airport or to crash on your couch or to help you move. Call a cab, book a room, hire some movers and repeat after me: Friends don't let friends come see their crappy play."," Hey, Lily's friend asked her to be in this play, and it's gonna be really good.  Okay, first of all, I've thought about it and top half fish. Second of all, we need you guys to decide something for us."
Barney," Yes, you should break up."," Okay, first of all, I've thought about it and top half fish. Second of all, we need you guys to decide something for us.  So, earlier tonight..."
Barney," Oh, God, why is this part of the story?"," I know we should, but you just look so sexy in my red sweatshirt.  We're getting to it."
Barney, What's wrong with her?," Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!  She hates that word."
Barney," What word, moist?"," She hates that word.  No! Seriously, stop!"
Barney," Ah, the 2005 landmark case of Lily v. The Joey Buttafuoco Pants."," Yeah, like we did with Marshall's pants.  Nice, right?"
Barney, I vote they can stay. Check out the jackass in the parachute pants is agood icebreaker., Yes!  Ted. Ted? Ted?
Barney," Marshall, it's over. We even gave you an appeal and they didn't look any better with combat boots."," They were insanely comfortable! They were like pajamas you could wear outside.  All right, well, let's hear the arguments. Ted, you go first."
Barney, I side with Robin.," All right, Barney. It all comes down to you.  What?"
Barney," Ted, your place is too cluttered. It's like you're living in a Bennigan's."," What?  Or a Danby's. What, they don't have Danby's in the US? Really? Well, then were do you get Grizzly Paw ice cream sandwiches?"
Barney," From the smell of it, I'm guessing a urine factory."," Eight flights, of stairs. Who puts a theater up eight flights of stairs? What kind of building is this?  Where do you guys want to sit?"
Barney, I know where I don't want to sit.," Where do you guys want to sit?  Guys, four together!"
Barney, I brought a bag in case anyone needs to puke.," Guys, four together!  Come on. It's not gonna be that bad."
Barney, No? Okay.The lights turn off and the play starts., Come on. It's not gonna be that bad.  I... am... Rage!
Barney, I am outta here.," I am Rage... Envy!  No, you're not. You have to stay."
Barney," Wow, Lily, that sucked!"," And when it became a play within a play, I was, like, Now we are really cookin'!  Barney!"
Barney," What? It was terrible. I mean, come on. You guys agree, right? Hey, sorry, I'm just being honest 'cause, you know, we're friends."," Barney!  No, friends make each other feel good. They build each other up and support them. That's what being a good friend is about."
Barney," Yeah, if you're a Smurf."," No, friends make each other feel good. They build each other up and support them. That's what being a good friend is about.  You know if you did a play, I would sit through the whole thing and I would compliment you on it afterwards."
Barney," Oh, really? You would?"," You know if you did a play, I would sit through the whole thing and I would compliment you on it afterwards.  Yes."
Barney," Bad move, Aldrin, bad move.", Yes.  We'll be starting our Q&A with the director-- yours truly-- in five minutes right here.Barney runs out
Barney, Even I wouldn't do that., What's the matter with you?  Yes!
Barney," Oh, I almost forgot. Flyers for my new play.", I miss Jebediah.  Very funny.
Barney," Oh, it's not a joke. It's my one-man show premiering tomorrow night. And even though it's terrible and excruciatingly long, I expect you all to be there since we're such good friends."," Very funny.  Oh, we'll be there."
Barney," Unless, of course, you just want to admit that you were wrong..."," Oh, we'll be there.  Never."
Barney," Good. Okay, I gotta go rehearse. Oh, I almost forgot. Bring a poncho; the first three rows get wet.", Never.  I'm sorry I didn't tell you where the dogs came from.
Barney, Moist. Moist. Moist. Moist.," I know, but I'm gonna sit through the whole thing, and I'm gonna say something nice about it afterwards. You know why? Because that's what friends do.  That was the first 40 minutes of Barney's show."
Barney, Moist., That was the first 40 minutes of Barney's show.  And then we endured about 20 minutes of this.
Barney, I have to go refill. I'll be back in a moment. Play's not over., And then we endured about 20 minutes of this.  I never get picked for audience participation.
Barney," Feelings. Inside. Oh, no!", And then it just got weird.  And when that didn't work...
Barney," Thank you, Lily. Is there anything you'd like to say about my show?"," Okay! Stop! You win. Fine. Barney, I'm sorry I made you come to my show.  No. No, I have nothing nice to say about your show. You were right, Barney. Let's go to the bar."
Barney," Yes! I win! I love winning! Oh, Lily. Oh, Lily, Lily, Lily. I was just getting"," No. No, I have nothing nice to say about your show. You were right, Barney. Let's go to the bar.  Well, I imagine it was pretty awful, so let's go."
Barney, Pretty awful? Pretty awful?! It was a masterpiece of awful. It's genius how bad it is. I kind of wish you guys could see it.," Well, I imagine it was pretty awful, so let's go.  Yeah, well, anyway."
Barney," Act two is where I really h*t my stride. Spoiler alert: the robot falls in love.Lily: How about this, Barney? How about we stay and-and watch the rest of your show?"," Yeah, well, anyway.  It's your funeral. Five, six, one, two."
Barney," It's your funeral. Five, six, one, two."," Act two is where I really h*t my stride. Spoiler alert: the robot falls in love.Lily: How about this, Barney? How about we stay and-and watch the rest of your show?  So we stayed and let Barney t*rture us for another hour and a half, 'cause that's what friends do, apparently."
Barney," The robot found love Confusing my circuitry My software's been hacked Toaster oven You're the one for me Two, three, four.", We're moving in together!  That's two.
Barney, We insisted.," We felt bad that you guys were missing the super-fun origami folding party, so... we suggested moving it here.  Terrific."
Barney, How's the Fiero?, Terrific.  She's still in triage.
Barney," Well, I'm trying, but it's..."," Barney. That's like the third one in a row that you've screwed up.  Look. You fold twice to the middle, fold back and forth, pull the ends out, flip over, open the flaps, fold the edges, crease the front, fold in half, fold the wings down, push in the bottom corners, and fold the wings back out. Or would you like one of my kindergartners to show you?"
Barney," Wait, wait, wait. Wait, I think I've got it."," Look. You fold twice to the middle, fold back and forth, pull the ends out, flip over, open the flaps, fold the edges, crease the front, fold in half, fold the wings down, push in the bottom corners, and fold the wings back out. Or would you like one of my kindergartners to show you?  No. Forget it; the paper's too expensive. You're out."
Barney," Aw, nerts.", No. Forget it; the paper's too expensive. You're out.  The food rule is insane. We could have died because of it. Remember the 100K fiasco?
Barney, Really? Seems impossible.," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. I think you skipped something.  Hey, we got some time. What do you say we get off the highway, take the road less traveled, you know? Robert Frost."
Barney," With privileges, from the sound of it.", That trip is when Marshall and I became best friends.  Eriksen.(Marshall follows the mechanic)
Barney, Wow. Looks like he really needs a hug. Ted.," Eriksen.(Marshall follows the mechanic)  He said it would be at least 3,000 bucks to make it run again. And even then, there's no guarantee."
Barney, How dare you...," I know that it's a lot of money, but it's my Fiero, you know? I'm about to graduate and take some sellout corporate law job, and without that Fiero, I'm just another guy in a suit.  Hey."
Barney," Come on, Marshall. This is your Fiero. You know the rightthing to do here."," I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.  Wow, Barney, why do you love that car so much?"
Barney, Love it? Hold on a second. Love it? I hate it!," Wow, Barney, why do you love that car so much?  What? Why?"
Barney, Why? Why? Why?! Why?!, What? Why?  Let me tell it. It was last year during the transit strike.
Barney," Hey. Uh, is Marshall around? I have a massage in Queens in half an hour. I need a ride."," Hey.  Uh, no, he's at the library all day. Just take the keys."
Barney, Hey! Why don't you drive me? It'll be like a total road trip.," Uh, no, he's at the library all day. Just take the keys.  To Queens?"
Barney," Yeah, we'll get, we'll get beef jerky, Triscuits."," To Queens? Uh, actually I have a lot of work to do, so."
Barney," Okay. Well, anyway, I'll cancel. See you later.","Uh, actually I have a lot of work to do, so.  Wait! You know how to drive, right?"
Barney," What, of course I know how to drive. I love driving. Hitting the road. Cruising the lanes. And braking. Honking. Love it. Except for lady drivers. Don't get me started on lady drivers."," Wait! You know how to drive, right?  Which pedal's the gas?"
Barney, Trick question.," Which pedal's the gas?  No, it's not"
Barney," Yes, it is."," No, it's not  No, it's not."
Barney," Middle, left, right? I never learned how to drive! I grew up in the city. I never had a chance."," No, it's not.  Well, guess what? You're getting your chance. Because I'm going to teach you. Barney Stinson, buckle up."
Barney, This isn't right. God never meant for us to travel at such breakneck speeds.," Well, guess what? You're getting your chance. Because I'm going to teach you. Barney Stinson, buckle up.  Relax. You're doing great. Ignore the old lady on the rascal; this isn't a race."
Barney," Dude, a dog."," Relax. You're doing great. Ignore the old lady on the rascal; this isn't a race.  Zitch dogs, this. Or nothing."
Barney," What do I do? Tell me what to do, Ted."," Zitch dogs, this. Or nothing.  Step on the brakes. Sometime in the next 20 minutes."
Barney, Which? Which one's the break again?, Step on the brakes. Sometime in the next 20 minutes.  The left one.
Barney," Left. Oh, man, left. I'm totally blanking.", The left one.  Make the Ls
Barney," Oh, we're not going to make it.", Make the Ls  Why did you just turn on the radio?
Barney," I don't know why I turned on the radio! We're going to die. Tell me what to do, Ted.", Why did you just turn on the radio?  Relax. You're being crazy.
Barney," Help me, Ted! I'm being serious."," Relax. You're being crazy.  Stop, drop and roll. Screaming is fun! Screaming is fun!"
Barney, I can't move. I can't... I can't feel my... Wait. Wait. We're okay.," Stop, drop and roll. Screaming is fun! Screaming is fun!  We're okay."
Barney," We're okay. It's a miracle, Ted!", We're okay.  Wow. Sounds like you had some accident in that car.
Barney," ummina-hummina-hummina-hummina ummina-hummina-hummina hummina. I shouldn't even be here, thanks to that deathtrap. But fate... fate gave me a second chance. And helped me realize that our days on this planet are too few to squander. So I decided from that moment on to continue living life to its fullest."," Actually, he had two accidents if you add the fact that he...  So you made a life-changing decision to not change your life at all."
Barney, True story., So you made a life-changing decision to not change your life at all.  Guys. This Fiero's meant a lot to all of us. Friendships were made. Adventures had. Horrors faced. That's why we have to get rid of it.
Barney, Yes!, Guys. This Fiero's meant a lot to all of us. Friendships were made. Adventures had. Horrors faced. That's why we have to get rid of it.  What?
Barney," Rot in hell, devil steed."," Arrivederci, Fiero! You were the freaking giving tree of cars.Lily: May you rust in peace.  And what better friend is there than that?"
Barney, Really? Then whatever happened to your plan of spending the last two weeks before your wedding sleeping apart?," Just because we like spending time together doesn't mean we're codependent.  Okay, we decided not to do that because of..."
Barney," Yeah. It's a dirty story, isn't it? You guys went out to dinner, did it in the kitchen and got caught. Scherbatsky reeks of someone who likes to get caught."," Long story. I'll tell you later.  Okay, now I have to wash up for two reasons."
Barney, So you and Lily really think you can spend two weeks apart?," Oh, you didn't. That's right.  You know what, Barney? Lily and I are a lot less chees than you make us out to be."
Barney, Night-night tape? Did you make a tape of you saying night-night to her?," Marshmallow, don't forget to pack my night-night tape.  No."
Barney," Oh, that is so sweet. Why don't you kiss? I love it when two chicks make out.", He doesn't say it. He sings it.  Damn it. Nobody's bought us anything cool yet off our registry.
Barney, What's on there?," Damn it. Nobody's bought us anything cool yet off our registry.  Ooh, lots of stuff. Kitchen Aide Artisan Series tilt-head stand mixer..."
Barney, Retail price $319.99. What else?," Ooh, lots of stuff. Kitchen Aide Artisan Series tilt-head stand mixer...  Um, the Dyson DC17 Animal vacuum."
Barney," Ah, $549.99. A little greedy, don't you think?"," Um, the Dyson DC17 Animal vacuum.  Did you memorize our registry?"
Barney," No, I'm training.", Did you memorize our registry?  Training? For what?
Barney," I'm glad you asked. Ted, Robin, get in here! You guys know how it's hard to be friends with me 'cause I'm so awesome?"," Training? For what?  Yes, it's hard to be friends with you. Go on."
Barney," Well, this isn't going to make it any easier. I am going to be on... The Price Is Right."," Yes, it's hard to be friends with you. Go on.  No way!"
Barney," Yes, in a couple days, Rich Fields is going to call out my name, and I will come on down."," What?!  Whoa, that is so awesome."
Barney," Are you kidding? T.P.I.R. is not just an indescribably entertaining hour of television, it's a microcosm of our entire economic system-- a capitalist utopia, where consumers are rewarded for their persistence, market acumen and intrepid spirit. I gaze upon the glory of The Price Is Right, and I see the face of America. And it is divine. Plus, you know, hot chicks on sports cars."," Barney, I didn't know you were such a fan of The Price is Right.  Then Lily headed out to Robin's for her first night away from Marshall."
Barney," So which one, A or B?"," His favorite grandson is getting married, Ted. I think he can take a day off from haunting the barn to make an appearance.  What was that?"
Barney," I have to decide how to run to contestant's row when they say, Barney Stinson, come on down!"," What was that?  Oh, I didn't realize that's what it was. Can you do them again?"
Barney," Yeah, of course."," Oh, I didn't realize that's what it was. Can you do them again?  Hey! Very funny. Just for that, when I win all the prizes, the only thing you guys are getting is Rice-A-Roni and Turtle Wax."
Barney," Hey! Very funny. Just for that, when I win all the prizes, the only thing you guys are getting is Rice-A-Roni and Turtle Wax."," Yeah, of course.  It's $300 just to take the bust in? Oh, please, you have to have some sympathy for me. I'm getting married next Saturday, and I'm too skinny for my dress. I lost all this weight without even trying. Hello?"
Barney," Check it out. Okay, imagine... imagine, if you will, that this is the $1 space on The Price Is Right wheel. Ready?(he turnst he wheel)"," Now, one thing I remember about the bar menu at McClaren's is that there were no fewer than 11 different deep-fried appetizers. That night, Aunt Lily ordered them all.  Oh, wow, that was pretty close."
Barney," Close? Close?! It's called The Price Is Right, not The Price Is Close! Oh, man, this is bad. If I don't win the spin-off, and I can't get into the Showcase Showdown, everything's ruined! It's all ruined!"," Oh, wow, that was pretty close.  What is ruined? Why, why is this such a big deal?"
Barney," Okay, guys... sit down, I've got to tell you something. The reason I'm going on The Price Is Right is because I've decided that it's time for me to meet my real father."," What is ruined? Why, why is this such a big deal?  Your father?"
Barney, That's right. My father... is Bob Barker., Your father?  Your dad... is Bob Barker?
Barney, That's right," Your dad... is Bob Barker?  The host of The Price Is Right, Bob Barker?"
Barney, That's Pops.," The host of The Price Is Right, Bob Barker?  Barney?"
Barney," Uh, because my mother told me he was, that's why."," Why in the world do you think Bob Barker is your father?  Mom, who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine?"
Barney," Mom, who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine?"," Uh, because my mother told me he was, that's why.  Oh, I don't know. That guy. (she shows him Bob Barker on TV)"
Barney," Oh, I don't know. That guy. (she shows him Bob Barker on TV)"," Mom, who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine? Look, Dad, I got straight A's!"
Barney,"Look, Dad, I got straight A's!"," Oh, I don't know. That guy. (she shows him Bob Barker on TV)  Hey, Dad, guess who I'm going as for Halloween?"
Barney," Want to play some catch, Pop?"," Hey, Dad, guess who I'm going as for Halloween?  So now I'm gonna go to L.A., be on the show, win the Showcase Showdown, make him proud of me, and then tell him who I am."
Barney," So now I'm gonna go to L.A., be on the show, win the Showcase Showdown, make him proud of me, and then tell him who I am."," Want to play some catch, Pop?  You're gonna tell Bob Barker that you're his son on national television?"
Barney, Why is this so hard for you people to believe?," You're gonna tell Bob Barker that you're his son on national television?  Drop the popper! Lily has to gain five pounds in a week and a half, and it is my job to help her get there."
Barney, Calcium promotes healthy teeth and bones.," Man, I'm well nourished right now!  Thanks, Marshall, for teaching us you don't need alcohol to have fun."
Barney," Nooo. Oh, my God!"," Bob, it's Barney Stinson! Come on down! You're the next contestant on The Price Is Right.  Working his way out. High-five here, high-five there. A big old hug here."
Barney," Yeah, I know, the camera loves me."," Oh, my God!  Welcome to contestant's row, Barney. Nice suit."
Barney," Thanks, Da... Bob."," Welcome to contestant's row, Barney. Nice suit.  Here is the next item up for bid!"
Barney," Um... Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Retail price is $1,349.99, so, since you round off, I'll say $1,350, Bob."," And Barney, what do you bid on that?  $1,350 for Barney."
Barney, I don't know. Was it?," So, was it $1,350?  Happy wedding."
Barney, Happy wedding.," I don't know. Was it?  Barney, you won that camcorder in just one second! That is impressive. I mean impressive."
Barney," Thank you, Bob."," Barney, you won that camcorder in just one second! That is impressive. I mean impressive.  Now, to win the computer, you're going to have to bid again, and again I will say higher or lower. And let's show the audience the price of the computer, and audience, please, do not try to help us. And the clock will start with your first bid."
Barney, $1 billion.," Now, to win the computer, you're going to have to bid again, and again I will say higher or lower. And let's show the audience the price of the computer, and audience, please, do not try to help us. And the clock will start with your first bid.  Lower."
Barney," So, I brought some photos that I thought you might like to see. This is me on my first birthday."," Lower.  Yes, Barney. This is..."
Barney," Uh, spending some quality time with my dad."," What are you doing?  That's very nice, but look, the clock is moving. You have only about 16 seconds. Keep bidding."
Barney," No, no, I want you to see this. This is great."," That's very nice, but look, the clock is moving. You have only about 16 seconds. Keep bidding.  Keep bidding."
Barney,$999.00 ," That, no, that's nice. That's nice. You have only five, four, three, two, one...  Nine... Barney, you got it exactly right!"
Barney, Happy wedding again!," Nine... Barney, you got it exactly right!  Oh, my..."
Barney," I have to be honest, Bob. The big wheel is the only weak part of my game."," Oh, my...  I'm sure you'll do just fine, son."
Barney," Did you just... I'm ready, Bob."," I'm sure you'll do just fine, son.  Do it! Do it! Here we go! He's looking for the dollar. It's going around, and around..."
Barney," Thank you, would you, would you say you're proud of me?"," Here it comes, Barney. You got it! You won... But Barney... Barney, you're not through. You've won $1,000. You've won a place in the showcase. You are doing splendidly so far.  Sure."
Barney," Please, no car and an above-ground spa? Pass."," Very well, Barney, you have seen the first showcase. Do you want to bid on it or do you want to pass it to Millie?  Millie, he has passed this showcase to you. What do you bid on it?"
Barney, Overbid!," $17,640.  Now, let's see Showcase #2. Barney, your showcase begins with a mystery."
Barney," Oh, I love this."," Now, let's see Showcase #2. Barney, your showcase begins with a mystery.  I can't believe how excited I am right now"
Barney," Please, please. Please. Let me. 1-8-4-2-1."," Barney, you have seen your showcase. What do you bid on it?  I don't even know what we're going to do with a dune buggy, but I want it!"
Barney,"$14,628.00 "," And the actual retail price of your showcase is...  $14,628. Millie, you are over. Too bad. Barney, you bid $18,421 on your showcase. And the actual retail price of Barney's showcase is... $18,421 exactly right! You win both showcases, Barney. Bob Barker, reminding you, help control the pet..."
Barney," Before, before we wrap up the show, there's just something I want to say to you.... Congratulations on 35 wonderful years hosting The Price Is Right."," $14,628. Millie, you are over. Too bad. Barney, you bid $18,421 on your showcase. And the actual retail price of Barney's showcase is... $18,421 exactly right! You win both showcases, Barney. Bob Barker, reminding you, help control the pet...  Well, thank you, Barney. Thank you..."
Barney, Have your pets spayed or neutered.," Well, thank you, Barney. Thank you...  Why didn't you tell him?"
Barney," Well, it's just... If you lived your whole life thinking one thing, it would be pretty devastating to find out that wasn't true. I just don't think Bob could have handled it.", Why didn't you tell him?  Bob. Yeah. Probably a good choice.
Barney," Anyway, on the bright side. Happy wedding again!", Bob. Yeah. Probably a good choice.  And that's the story of how Uncle Barney gave Lily and Marshall a dune buggy for their wedding.
Barney, And maybe you already know someone who went down to the courthouse and registered as an officiant so that he or she-- he-- could perform the ceremony.," So, we've decided on a small, outdoor wedding, just family and close friends. No more than 25 people in a beautiful garden somewhere, maybe an acoustic guitar playing while we walk down the aisle.  But you hate marriage. Why do you want to perform the ceremony?"
Barney," Because it subtly implants in the mind of every woman there that when I ask a question, you say, I do. Yeah."," But you hate marriage. Why do you want to perform the ceremony?  The closer you get to the big day, the more concessions you make."
Barney, Is she hot? I'd love to be able to cross harp player off my list.," So now, instead of an acoustic guitar, we're having a harp player. Yeah. My dad owes a guy, and... that guy's daughter plays the harp.  How long is this list?"
Barney," Dude, I'm not gonna count how many pages the list is. I'm not crass."," How long is this list?  Well, it doesn't matter anyway. She's pregnant."
Barney, Sweet! I can cross off two things.," Well, it doesn't matter anyway. She's pregnant.  And the day arrives for Lily and Marshall's very big indoor wedding... with a harp."
Barney, Can I grab a scotch and soda real quick?," Robin, I'm not going to freak myself out. I hate those women who say, Oh, my wedding has to be perfect. Things go wrong. Sometimes the deejay screws up your playlist. Sometimes you slip on placenta during the recessional.  No. I'm not allowed to serve anything until the reception."
Barney," Wow. You just cost yourself a big tip, buddy."," No. I'm not allowed to serve anything until the reception.  I'm not allowed to accept tips, buddy."
Barney," You allowed to accept criticism? You, sir, are an ass... buddy."," I'm not allowed to accept tips, buddy.  Hey, you want to know what line doesn't work on a harp player? Hey, baby, want to pluck?"
Barney," Hey, you want to know what line doesn't work on a harp player? Hey, baby, want to pluck?"," You allowed to accept criticism? You, sir, are an ass... buddy.  Really? That didn't work."
Barney, Not even a little. Hey! Who's Bill?, Really? That didn't work.  Bill?
Barney, Yeah. This guy came up to me at the bar., Bill?  Can I ask you something? Where in the ceremony is the place where they ask if anyone objects?
Barney, Uh... Don't think they do that anymore.," Can I ask you something? Where in the ceremony is the place where they ask if anyone objects?  Oh, so when do you think someone should do it? Just wait for a lull or what?"
Barney, He kind of did.," Oh, no. Did he look like a guy who tried to be an umpire but failed?  That's Scooter."
Barney, I'll get it.," Our families are really close. But my ex-boyfriend? Come on, Mom. I didn't invite that professional squash player Dad busted you with. Oh, I need a glass of wine.  Oh, thanks. Hey, how's Marshall doing?"
Barney, He's great. He's about to get his hair cut.," Oh, thanks. Hey, how's Marshall doing?  Oh. I'm worried my cousin's going to cut it too short."
Barney," Me, too. I was up all night."," Oh. I'm worried my cousin's going to cut it too short.  Hello, Lily."
Barney," Hey, Bill."," Hello, Lily.  Hey, Barney."
Barney, I need a glass of wine., I want... I want... Scooter!  And I need you to get out of my face.
Barney," It's for the bride, so..."," And I need you to get out of my face.  White. And, uh... she'd also like a scotch and soda."
Barney," White. And, uh... she'd also like a scotch and soda."," It's for the bride, so...  You got it."
Barney, She'd also like a bowl of smoked almonds.," You got it.  I don't have any, but I guess I could run out to the corner and get some."
Barney," Well, it's only the biggest day of her life, so...The barman leaves... Let the games begin."," I don't have any, but I guess I could run out to the corner and get some.  Here. Can't stay. Got to try something."
Barney, Here. Can't stay. Got to try something.," Well, it's only the biggest day of her life, so...The barman leaves... Let the games begin.  Maybe my words won't change your mind, but maybe the words of a poet will. I read from November Rain. By W. Axl Rose."
Barney, Hey., I'm on it.  Hey.
Barney, Can I have your phone number?, Hey.  No.
Barney, It's for the bride., No.  Oh. Hold on. Let me go get a pen.
Barney, The bride wants you to walk slower.," Oh. Hold on. Let me go get a pen.  Oh, wow."
Barney," Well, it's not too short.", What?  My hair! Look at my hair! She ruined my hair! I look like one of the Backstreet Boys!
Barney," You totally do. And not even the good Backstreet Boys, the older, lame dance move, comeback tour Backstreet Boys.", My hair! Look at my hair! She ruined my hair! I look like one of the Backstreet Boys!  The good Backstreet Boys?
Barney," Ah, let me see what I can do.", I can't get married like this! There's no way!  What? What can you do?
Barney, I have a superpower., What? What can you do?  Lily is gonna k*ll me! Look at me! She's not gonna want to marry me like this.
Barney," Could I have everyone's attention, please? It's for the bride. One, the bride would... like all of this tension out of my shoulders. And she would like, let's say, you in the inappropriatel short dress to rub them. Two... What was two?"," Oh, great. So now you're saying Lily and I shouldn't even get married?In the wedding room...  Okay, we have a bit of a situation. Let's not panic. Let's just find a solution."
Barney, The bride needs this.," Let me come at this from a different angle. I got $50 in my pocket which is probably a lot more...Barney comes and takes the toupee.  Actually, I think it kinda works."
Barney," To be honest, I'm, uh, I'm jealous I don't get to wear it."," Barney?  Okay, problem solved. Crisis averted. Let's get me married. It looks terrible, doesn't it?"
Barney, It would cover up the problem. It's festive and it celebrates the heritage of this great nation.," Okay, you know what? I need some air. I think we should go for a walk, okay?  Okay, unless you actually have one in your car, stop suggesting authentic Native American headdress."
Barney," Yes. Yes, I can. Uh, excuse me, guys. You all dropped something: your jaws-- because Barney Stinson is about to aid and abet a marriage."," Get married now. Right here. Look, it's outside like you always wanted. Intimate, close friends. There's no guitar, but it's pretty close. Barney can officiate.  Could we even do that? I mean, what about all those people in there?"
Barney," Thank you all for coming. For those of you who don't know me... I'm not the biggest believer in marriage. But... you two are so great together, you know? It's like you were, uh, made for each other.", Hat. We thought of authentic Native American headdress before we thought of hat.  He's gonna cry.
Barney," No, I'm not. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not. Lily and Marshall... when everyone sees you, they... see true love. It's the best love... Can we just, um, move on to the rings or something?"," He's gonna cry.  Oh, no. I don't have my vows."
Barney, It's totally okay.," No problem.  My turn. Oh, thank you. Marshall, I love you because you're funny and you make me feel loved and you make me feel safe and for our anniversary you gave me a sweatshirt that says, Lily and Marshall. Rockin' It Since '96. I kinda wish I was wearing it right now 'cause it smells like you. But the main reason I love you, Marshall Ericksen, is you make me happy. You make me happy all the time."
Barney," Marshall, do you take Lily to be your wife to have and to hold from this day forward?", I'm good.  Slow down.
Barney, I can't From this day forward so as long as you both shall live?, Slow down.  I do.
Barney," Lily, do you promise to take Marshall to be your husband to have and to hold... live?", I do.  I do.
Barney," Okay, then, by the power invested in me by the very bitter old Pakistani man who works down at the courthouse on Lafayette Street, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.", I do.  Did you smoke?
Barney, Tell people what?," I guess starting tomorrow, we can tell people.  Hi, Barney."
Barney, Tell people what?," Hi, Barney.  The food looks delicious, doesn't it?"
Barney, Tell people what?," The food looks delicious, doesn't it?  Nothing."
Barney," Oh, okay. Tell people what?", Nothing.  Can we talk about this later?
Barney, Absolutely. Tell people what?, Can we talk about this later?  Hi. Have you met Barney?
Barney," Hey. Barney Stinson. Lovely dress. I know, I'm sick of these things, too. It's like the same wedding over and over again. You're totally right. You want to dance? Great, see you out there. Tell people what?"," Hi. Have you met Barney?  Look, this is just not something we want to talk about right now, okay, Barney?"
Barney, Okay. (Barney leaves)," Look, this is just not something we want to talk about right now, okay, Barney?  Whoo, that was a close one."
Barney, Tell people what?," Can I get a water please?  Oh, God! Okay. Look, we have some... news."
Barney, Fine.," So just forget about it until they leave for the honeymoon.  It's pretty big, though."
Barney," Oh, my God, just tell me!"," It's pretty big, though.  Oh, help us."
Barney, What list?," Oh, that's great. Going on the list.  Horrible wedding clich'es we're not going to touch with a ten-foot limbo pole."
Barney," Oh, like First Corinthians? That Bible verse? They do that at every wedding.", Horrible wedding clich'es we're not going to touch with a ten-foot limbo pole.  How's it go?
Barney," Anyway, guys, we're kind of in the middle of something, so if you could go bicker or share a tense, sexless silence or whatever married people do somewhere else, that'd be great."," Yeah...  No, Barney, this is my wedding, and I will sit wherever I damn well..."
Barney, Are those mini quiches? (Marshall and Lily run) Tell the secret.," No, Barney, this is my wedding, and I will sit wherever I damn well...  Okay, uh... it was our anniversary, so we went to this restaurant Carmichael's, which is where we went on our first date. Remember, the place where I stole the blue French horn for Robin?"
Barney," Oh, right, that was you. I knew that was somebody I knew."," Okay, uh... it was our anniversary, so we went to this restaurant Carmichael's, which is where we went on our first date. Remember, the place where I stole the blue French horn for Robin?  What? Dude, you were there. That was like a big iconic moment in all of our lives."
Barney, Maybe in your life-- I got a lot of stuff going on.," What? Dude, you were there. That was like a big iconic moment in all of our lives.  Okay, so we're sitting there and the waiter comes over..."
Barney," Oh, that's right, they moved that table back toward the kitchen, because that's where they're setting up a surprise chocolate fountain. Oh, no, I gave it away.(Lily and Marshall leave) So what was in the glass?"," Mini quiche. You're a mega-douche.  Right. So the waiter comes up with two glasses of Dom. He says, Champagne? We didn't order any champagne. Compliments of the house. Wow."
Barney, You said that already!," Right. So the waiter comes up with two glasses of Dom. He says, Champagne? We didn't order any champagne. Compliments of the house. Wow.  Right. So Robin looks down, and there at the bottom of her glass..."
Barney, Don't get married., Anything you want to say to the bride and groom?  Why don't I come back.
Barney," An engagement ring?No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Ted, you cannot do", Why don't I come back.  That's what she said.
Barney, So what happened next?," Oh, look, more strawberries!  Ted, don't do this."
Barney," Oh, my God. You guys broke up. You guys broke up. I can't believe it."," We have an expiration date, don't we?  Barney... story's not over."
Barney, Run? Your strategy was run?, Run!  It was a perfectly good idea. They didn't have our credit card information. They didn't know us from Adam. I stand by it.
Barney," No es posible! Nobody moves to Argentina. The Argentinean peso has dropped two-thirds in five years, the government is opposed to free market reforms, and the railroad has been a mess since the breakup of Ferrocarriles Argentinos. I hooked up with an Argentinean exchange student in a Porta-John outside Yankee Stadium. Man, she was chatty.", Okay. Let's do it-- let's move to Argentina.  Right? Right?
Barney, You caught the bouquet?, Right? Right?  Barney. The story's not over yet.
Barney," That's when you run. Tell me you ran, Ted."," Ted, you know that kids were never a part of my plan. But if I was going to have someone's babies, I'd have your babies.  Wait, wait, wait. We don't want to start having babies right this second. Do you have a...?"
Barney, No.," Risk it.  All right, ladies and gentlemen, if you're all gather around, Lily and Marshall are going to cut the cake."
Barney," No. Robin, you're not... No, say the story's not over."," All right, ladies and gentlemen, if you're all gather around, Lily and Marshall are going to cut the cake.  Come on, they're cutting the cake."
Barney," Say the story's not over! Oh, God, this is the 12th most worried I've ever been that someone's pregnant."," Come on, they're cutting the cake.  Okay, Lily. I'm really hungry, so let's just, uh, aim for my mouth, okay? Besides, the smearing the cake thing's a clich'e, remember?"
Barney," Getting married, having kids. It's all a mistake. It's a horrible, horrible mistake."," We love you. I love you.  God, this guy's giving me nothing."
Barney, You did break up., I would have stolen you a whole orchestra.  Yep.
Barney, You're not pregnant?, Yep.  Nope.
Barney, An-And Marshall and Lily don't know?," Nope.  Well, afterwards, uh, we came by to tell you guys, but Lily was pretty stressed out, so..."
Barney, You guys okay?," We decided not to say anything till after the wedding.  Well, it hasn't been the easiest two weeks of our lives, but..."
Barney," I'm really sorry about you and Robin. I know I was always joking around about wanting you two to break up, but you were really good together."," So Marshall and Lily were married, and Robin and I were broken up. And as hard as it was at the time, in the end we both got what we wanted. She did eventually go on to live in Argentina and Morocco and Greece, Russia, even Japan for a little while. And I... well, I met your mom. I think for the most part if you're really honest with yourself about what you want out of life, Of course, at that moment, all I really wanted was a scotch and soda and a cigar.  Yeah... we were. She just wasn't the one, you know?"
Barney," The one. Oh, Ted, no. Do not tell me you're going to start searching for the one again. The only time I want to hear you saying the one is if it's followed by the word hundredth. What up?"," Yeah... we were. She just wasn't the one, you know?  No, I need a break from all that, I... I just want to get out there and have fun for a while, you know?"
Barney," Really? 'Cause... you know, you've been in a relationship for a year. You're going to... be a little rusty."," No, I need a break from all that, I... I just want to get out there and have fun for a while, you know?  Yeah."
Barney," I'm just saying... you're gonna need, need, need some help out there.", Yeah.  Could be.
Barney, Ted?," Could be.  Yes, Barney."
Barney, Do you think... Do you think maybe you might... need a wingman again?," Yes, Barney.  I do."
Barney," Yes! Yes! We're back. We are back. And Ted, my boy, it's going to be legend... Wait for it...", I do.
Barney,"...Dary! Legendary! Dude, I am so excited that you're single again. We're going to conquer New York City. I already have a girl from work lined up for you. Right boob bigger than the left boob, which some choose to look at as bra half empty. I choose to look at as bra half full."," Kids, there's more than one story of how I met your mother. (Cut to a yellow umbrella floating down a street) You know the short version, the thing with your mom's yellow umbrella. But there's a bigger story. The story of how I became who I had to become before I could meet her. And that story begins here.  I dont' know... Robin and I broke up two weeks ago. I'm... I'm not ready."
Barney, When will you be ready?," I dont' know... Robin and I broke up two weeks ago. I'm... I'm not ready.  It was a good question. (Flashback of Robin and Ted hugging after breaking up) After a big relationship ends, you need some time to recuperate. Robin took a trip to Argentina, and I went through my usual routine. (End Flashback)"
Barney," Ted Mosby, suit up, 'cause here's the plan. There's a Miss Nassau County pageant. We'll pretend to be judges and, yes, our votes are for sale.", I grew my breakup beard.  I'm not ready.
Barney, Finish line of a woman 10K. Salty girls on an endorphin high who just want to lie down. Yeah., I repainted the apartment.  I'm not ready.
Barney, Female acrobats from Montreal. Super flexible. We're going to get Cirque de So-Laid. What up?," And the truth is, I was doing really good.  Barney, come on, we've covered this."
Barney," Of course it's a competition, Lil. How else do you explain... what's his name?", That's my wife.  Gael.
Barney, Kyle?, Gael.  Gael.
Barney," That's a great point, Persian nightclub owner."," (With only a mustache now) What a jerk? I don't go to your stupid country and try to seduce woman with my sexy accent.  And, oh, he is a masseuse."
Barney," How? How would one do that exactly? Seriously, don't giggle. Tell me.", Career? Such an American idea. My career is living. Windsurfing. Making love. Sometimes at the same time.  Not possible. You cannot have sex on a windsurfing board.
Barney, Not possible. You cannot have sex on a windsurfing board.," How? How would one do that exactly? Seriously, don't giggle. Tell me.  How do you know?"
Barney," Glad you asked Lily. I have crafted a list of every vehicle land-based, aquatic and airborne in which/on which it's possible to have sex. And of those 33 vehicles, I have had sex in/on 31. Windsurfing board, not on the list, not possible. Oh, P.S., in order to h*t 33, all I need is bobsled and the Apollo 11 space capsule."," How do you know?  To get that last one, you'd have to break into the Smithsonian."
Barney, This conversation never happened.," To get that last one, you'd have to break into the Smithsonian.  All right, you're suit up, I bearded down. Let's get out there and win this thing."
Barney, Yes!," All right, you're suit up, I bearded down. Let's get out there and win this thing.  You guys, have fun of your duble date."
Barney," Hum-hum. Not for long. Okay, pep talk. Take a knee. Ted, tonight, we're going to get you someone way hotter than Robin. Okay, Robin's a ten. Fine we'll get you a 12. Or, you know... two sixes. Failing that, four threes. And break glass in case of emergency we'll go the Staten Island, I'll get you 12 ones. Ted, my boy, I'm going to re-teach you... Ah."," I just want to make sure you're okay with this? Damn it! I can't believe she's the one that gest to say that. She's winning, isn't she?  Amy."
Barney," Barney. Ted, we are back. Up here. Up high. Fivin' it up five-style!", Ted.  Weird? Why would it be weird? Because you used to date our best friend or because my wife thinks your new boyfriend is incredibly hot?
Barney, Ted. Ted. Ted. Ted. Ted., Damn it! (To Lily) He checks out...  What?!!
Barney," Let's bail, this place is d*ad."," What?!!  Yeah, you're right. We're both totally striking out."
Barney," Yes, exactly, plus, we're on a tight schedule. I've got the entire evening perfectly planned out... Spoiler alert: Our last stop is an after hours club so after hours, it's three days from now. What up?"," Yeah, you're right. We're both totally striking out.  Are you blind? I'm making out with a 12. I am winning."
Barney, Yeah. But I didn't get to help., Are you blind? I'm making out with a 12. I am winning.  So you're saying you want me to throw away a super hot girl just because you didn't help me get her?
Barney, Apology accepted. Let's go., So you're saying you want me to throw away a super hot girl just because you didn't help me get her?  Who's the suit?
Barney," I'm not gonna remember that. Now, if you'll excuse me, random chick from earlier tonight, as you shall henceforth be known. Ted and I have a schedule to keep."," Hum. This is Barney. Barney, Amy.  Oh, well. You can check out off 08:54, dress up like a dork and bother the cool kids. b*at it, nerd."
Barney," Wow. Wow. Great stuff, Tommy Lee. See what you don't understand is, I'm Ted wingman. It's a sacred bond, much stronger that any... They're making out again!"," Oh, well. You can check out off 08:54, dress up like a dork and bother the cool kids. b*at it, nerd.  Massage therapist. And you know what, Gayle? Your piece of chicken looks a little tense to me. Oh, oh, does that feel good, Mr. Chicken? Well, guess what? I didn't wash my hands. Got him."
Barney, They know us here! You're gonna get us in trouble., The night was doing great. Amy was cool and dangerous. She found a friend for Barney. She even paid for drinks... (Amy steals liquor from behind the bar) sort of.  Tell me something. Do you ask your tailor to leave extra room in the crotch for your huge vagina?
Barney," You... your vagina... Ted, this chick is crazy. We're leaving.", Tell me something. Do you ask your tailor to leave extra room in the crotch for your huge vagina?  Good idea. Let's all go back to my place.
Barney," Your place? Thanks, but no thanks,'94 Courtney Love.", Good idea. Let's all go back to my place.  I have a hot tub.
Barney," Okay, this place is actually pretty nice.", I have a hot tub.  I like your tatts.
Barney," Wrong. Ted has a classic clean-cut look that never goes out of style season after season, burn."," Oh, thanks. You should get one.  Yeah? Well. I think he would look hot with some ink."
Barney," No, he wouldn't."," Yeah? Well. I think he would look hot with some ink.  Yes, he would."
Barney," No, he wouldn't."," Yes, he would.  Yuh-huh."
Barney, Nuh-uh., Yuh-huh.  I'm ready to do anything you want by the way. Anything. Right now.
Barney, Ted. Who are you gonna side with on this tattoos thing?, I'm ready to do anything you want by the way. Anything. Right now.  I think I'd look way hot with some ink.
Barney," Unfair? I wouldn't let you take care of the imaginary kids I make up to score with single moms. That's it Ted, we're going home. Ted? Ted, you okay?", Sorry. I used to nanny for those jerks before they fired me. So unfair.  Robin and Gael are windsurfing)
Barney," You're not getting a tattoo. It's not you. Ted, you are heading down a dark path."," I'm okay. In fact, here's how okay I am. I'm gettin' a tattoo.  That dark path is my driveway."
Barney, But you need a plan and you need a wingman!, That dark path is my driveway.  This is so going in my blog!
Barney, This is so going in my blog!, But you need a plan and you need a wingman!  Want to have sex?
Barney, Okay.," Want to have sex?  Oh, f*re. We should start a f*re."
Barney," Hey, guys, what's the big emergency? Oh and B the W: I am never speaking to Ted again."," Way ahead of you.  Hum. Really, never? Not even if, say, butterflies flew out of his ass?"
Barney, What?," Hum. Really, never? Not even if, say, butterflies flew out of his ass?  Hum. Ted? Could you grab me the fondue pot?"
Barney, Ted?, Hum. Hum. What?  Hmm?
Barney, I came here this morning because... I want to apologize.," Hmm?  Apology accepted, Barney. As you can see, I do just fine on my own. I don't need a baby-sitter."
Barney," See. All this time, I thought you need a wingman to fly, but the truth is you... you've got your own wings now."," Apology accepted, Barney. As you can see, I do just fine on my own. I don't need a baby-sitter.  Hmm."
Barney," Since you and Robin split, you've been gestating. Growing in your cocoon. And last night... you burst out of that cocoon..., like a majestic, uh... gosh, what is it that comes out of a cocoon? I was always bad at science.", Hmm.  He's gonna say it.
Barney," Nothing, buddy.", A butterfly? (Everyone laughs) What?  Ow. Why did that hurt so...? Oh my God! (Looks in mirror) I have a tattoo.
Barney," Oh, that's not a tattoo. That, dear boy, is a tramp stamp.", Ow. Why did that hurt so...? Oh my God! (Looks in mirror) I have a tattoo.  Tramp stamp?
Barney," You know, a ho tat. Ass antlers. A Panama City license plate.", Tramp stamp?  And suddenly it all came back to me.
Barney," Oh, yeah, that'll get it out.", No no no no no no no. Give me this.  Maybe you should try club soda.
Barney, Go for Barney.," Kids, I can't remember exactly what helped me get through the whole Robin-Gael incident. I'm sure it was something profound and meaningful and not at all macho and petty. But after that, I was back on my feet. And what followed was a new era in my life. A crazy time unlike anything that came before. (The camera goes outside to show a sea of black umbrellas, and one yellow one walking through the crowd) It's funny looking back on those days, knowing now exactly what I was heading towards, and what was heading towards me.  Hey, man. It's Marshall. Check your e-mail. Sent you something."
Barney, What is it?," Hey, man. It's Marshall. Check your e-mail. Sent you something.  Just a new website. Slapcountdown.com."
Barney, What does this mean? Marshall? Ma...?, 23: 59: 57...and counting)  No. (screams) No!
Barney, No. (screams) No!, What does this mean? Marshall? Ma...?
Barney, Really? Then whatever happened to your plan of spending the last two weeks before your wedding sleeping apart?," Just because we like spending time together doesn't mean we're codependent.  Okay, we decided not to do that because of..."
Barney," Yeah. It's a dirty story, isn't it? You guys went out to dinner, did it in the kitchen and got caught. Scherbatsky reeks of someone who likes to get caught."," Long story. I'll tell you later.  Okay, now I have to wash up for two reasons."
Barney, So you and Lily really think you can spend two weeks apart?," Oh, you didn't. That's right.  You know what, Barney? Lily and I are a lot less chees than you make us out to be."
Barney, Night-night tape? Did you make a tape of you saying night-night to her?," Marshmallow, don't forget to pack my night-night tape.  No."
Barney," Oh, that is so sweet. Why don't you kiss? I love it when two chicks make out.", He doesn't say it. He sings it.  Damn it. Nobody's bought us anything cool yet off our registry.
Barney, What's on there?," Damn it. Nobody's bought us anything cool yet off our registry.  Ooh, lots of stuff. Kitchen Aide Artisan Series tilt-head stand mixer..."
Barney, Retail price $319.99. What else?," Ooh, lots of stuff. Kitchen Aide Artisan Series tilt-head stand mixer...  Um, the Dyson DC17 Animal vacuum."
Barney," Ah, $549.99. A little greedy, don't you think?"," Um, the Dyson DC17 Animal vacuum.  Did you memorize our registry?"
Barney," No, I'm training.", Did you memorize our registry?  Training? For what?
Barney," I'm glad you asked. Ted, Robin, get in here! You guys know how it's hard to be friends with me 'cause I'm so awesome?"," Training? For what?  Yes, it's hard to be friends with you. Go on."
Barney," Well, this isn't going to make it any easier. I am going to be on... The Price Is Right."," Yes, it's hard to be friends with you. Go on.  No way!"
Barney," Yes, in a couple days, Rich Fields is going to call out my name, and I will come on down."," What?!  Whoa, that is so awesome."
Barney," Are you kidding? T.P.I.R. is not just an indescribably entertaining hour of television, it's a microcosm of our entire economic system-- a capitalist utopia, where consumers are rewarded for their persistence, market acumen and intrepid spirit. I gaze upon the glory of The Price Is Right, and I see the face of America. And it is divine. Plus, you know, hot chicks on sports cars."," Barney, I didn't know you were such a fan of The Price is Right.  Then Lily headed out to Robin's for her first night away from Marshall."
Barney," So which one, A or B?"," His favorite grandson is getting married, Ted. I think he can take a day off from haunting the barn to make an appearance.  What was that?"
Barney," I have to decide how to run to contestant's row when they say, Barney Stinson, come on down!"," What was that?  Oh, I didn't realize that's what it was. Can you do them again?"
Barney," Yeah, of course."," Oh, I didn't realize that's what it was. Can you do them again?  Hey! Very funny. Just for that, when I win all the prizes, the only thing you guys are getting is Rice-A-Roni and Turtle Wax."
Barney," Hey! Very funny. Just for that, when I win all the prizes, the only thing you guys are getting is Rice-A-Roni and Turtle Wax."," Yeah, of course.  It's $300 just to take the bust in? Oh, please, you have to have some sympathy for me. I'm getting married next Saturday, and I'm too skinny for my dress. I lost all this weight without even trying. Hello?"
Barney," Check it out. Okay, imagine... imagine, if you will, that this is the $1 space on The Price Is Right wheel. Ready?(he turnst he wheel)"," Now, one thing I remember about the bar menu at McClaren's is that there were no fewer than 11 different deep-fried appetizers. That night, Aunt Lily ordered them all.  Oh, wow, that was pretty close."
Barney," Close? Close?! It's called The Price Is Right, not The Price Is Close! Oh, man, this is bad. If I don't win the spin-off, and I can't get into the Showcase Showdown, everything's ruined! It's all ruined!"," Oh, wow, that was pretty close.  What is ruined? Why, why is this such a big deal?"
Barney," Okay, guys... sit down, I've got to tell you something. The reason I'm going on The Price Is Right is because I've decided that it's time for me to meet my real father."," What is ruined? Why, why is this such a big deal?  Your father?"
Barney, That's right. My father... is Bob Barker., Your father?  Your dad... is Bob Barker?
Barney, That's right," Your dad... is Bob Barker?  The host of The Price Is Right, Bob Barker?"
Barney, That's Pops.," The host of The Price Is Right, Bob Barker?  Barney?"
Barney," Uh, because my mother told me he was, that's why."," Why in the world do you think Bob Barker is your father?  Mom, who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine?"
Barney," Mom, who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine?"," Uh, because my mother told me he was, that's why.  Oh, I don't know. That guy. (she shows him Bob Barker on TV)"
Barney," Oh, I don't know. That guy. (she shows him Bob Barker on TV)"," Mom, who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine? Look, Dad, I got straight A's!"
Barney,"Look, Dad, I got straight A's!"," Oh, I don't know. That guy. (she shows him Bob Barker on TV)  Hey, Dad, guess who I'm going as for Halloween?"
Barney," Want to play some catch, Pop?"," Hey, Dad, guess who I'm going as for Halloween?  So now I'm gonna go to L.A., be on the show, win the Showcase Showdown, make him proud of me, and then tell him who I am."
Barney," So now I'm gonna go to L.A., be on the show, win the Showcase Showdown, make him proud of me, and then tell him who I am."," Want to play some catch, Pop?  You're gonna tell Bob Barker that you're his son on national television?"
Barney, Why is this so hard for you people to believe?," You're gonna tell Bob Barker that you're his son on national television?  Drop the popper! Lily has to gain five pounds in a week and a half, and it is my job to help her get there."
Barney, Calcium promotes healthy teeth and bones.," Man, I'm well nourished right now!  Thanks, Marshall, for teaching us you don't need alcohol to have fun."
Barney," Nooo. Oh, my God!"," Bob, it's Barney Stinson! Come on down! You're the next contestant on The Price Is Right.  Working his way out. High-five here, high-five there. A big old hug here."
Barney," Yeah, I know, the camera loves me."," Oh, my God!  Welcome to contestant's row, Barney. Nice suit."
Barney," Thanks, Da... Bob."," Welcome to contestant's row, Barney. Nice suit.  Here is the next item up for bid!"
Barney," Um... Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Retail price is $1,349.99, so, since you round off, I'll say $1,350, Bob."," And Barney, what do you bid on that?  $1,350 for Barney."
Barney, I don't know. Was it?," So, was it $1,350?  Happy wedding."
Barney, Happy wedding.," I don't know. Was it?  Barney, you won that camcorder in just one second! That is impressive. I mean impressive."
Barney," Thank you, Bob."," Barney, you won that camcorder in just one second! That is impressive. I mean impressive.  Now, to win the computer, you're going to have to bid again, and again I will say higher or lower. And let's show the audience the price of the computer, and audience, please, do not try to help us. And the clock will start with your first bid."
Barney, $1 billion.," Now, to win the computer, you're going to have to bid again, and again I will say higher or lower. And let's show the audience the price of the computer, and audience, please, do not try to help us. And the clock will start with your first bid.  Lower."
Barney," So, I brought some photos that I thought you might like to see. This is me on my first birthday."," Lower.  Yes, Barney. This is..."
Barney," Uh, spending some quality time with my dad."," What are you doing?  That's very nice, but look, the clock is moving. You have only about 16 seconds. Keep bidding."
Barney," No, no, I want you to see this. This is great."," That's very nice, but look, the clock is moving. You have only about 16 seconds. Keep bidding.  Keep bidding."
Barney,$999.00 ," That, no, that's nice. That's nice. You have only five, four, three, two, one...  Nine... Barney, you got it exactly right!"
Barney, Happy wedding again!," Nine... Barney, you got it exactly right!  Oh, my..."
Barney," I have to be honest, Bob. The big wheel is the only weak part of my game."," Oh, my...  I'm sure you'll do just fine, son."
Barney," Did you just... I'm ready, Bob."," I'm sure you'll do just fine, son.  Do it! Do it! Here we go! He's looking for the dollar. It's going around, and around..."
Barney," Thank you, would you, would you say you're proud of me?"," Here it comes, Barney. You got it! You won... But Barney... Barney, you're not through. You've won $1,000. You've won a place in the showcase. You are doing splendidly so far.  Sure."
Barney," Please, no car and an above-ground spa? Pass."," Very well, Barney, you have seen the first showcase. Do you want to bid on it or do you want to pass it to Millie?  Millie, he has passed this showcase to you. What do you bid on it?"
Barney, Overbid!," $17,640.  Now, let's see Showcase #2. Barney, your showcase begins with a mystery."
Barney," Oh, I love this."," Now, let's see Showcase #2. Barney, your showcase begins with a mystery.  I can't believe how excited I am right now"
Barney," Please, please. Please. Let me. 1-8-4-2-1."," Barney, you have seen your showcase. What do you bid on it?  I don't even know what we're going to do with a dune buggy, but I want it!"
Barney,"$14,628.00 "," And the actual retail price of your showcase is...  $14,628. Millie, you are over. Too bad. Barney, you bid $18,421 on your showcase. And the actual retail price of Barney's showcase is... $18,421 exactly right! You win both showcases, Barney. Bob Barker, reminding you, help control the pet..."
Barney," Before, before we wrap up the show, there's just something I want to say to you.... Congratulations on 35 wonderful years hosting The Price Is Right."," $14,628. Millie, you are over. Too bad. Barney, you bid $18,421 on your showcase. And the actual retail price of Barney's showcase is... $18,421 exactly right! You win both showcases, Barney. Bob Barker, reminding you, help control the pet...  Well, thank you, Barney. Thank you..."
Barney, Have your pets spayed or neutered.," Well, thank you, Barney. Thank you...  Why didn't you tell him?"
Barney," Well, it's just... If you lived your whole life thinking one thing, it would be pretty devastating to find out that wasn't true. I just don't think Bob could have handled it.", Why didn't you tell him?  Bob. Yeah. Probably a good choice.
Barney," Anyway, on the bright side. Happy wedding again!", Bob. Yeah. Probably a good choice.  And that's the story of how Uncle Barney gave Lily and Marshall a dune buggy for their wedding.
Barney," Use your words, Ted."," Oh my God. Barney...oh my God.  OK. Barney, I'm about to go for the belt."
Barney, The belt?," OK. Barney, I'm about to go for the belt.  The belt."
Barney, But that's impossible. You were up here less than half an hour ago.," The belt.  Yes, advantage Ericksen."
Barney, Don't get cocky. Wimbledon lasts a fortnight.," Yes, advantage Ericksen.  Fortnight. British words are so cool. Plus, did you know lawyers there get to wear wigs? I wear a wig to work, I'm a jackass."
Barney, You take too long to get ready," What? We agreed, I suited up.  What are you talking about? I got the low-maintenance, just-rolled-out-of-bed look."
Barney, And then he starts on his hair. Ace.," Yeah, which takes an hour and a half of waxing, tugging and teasing to achieve.  Ha ha ha ha. Look, are we going or not?"
Barney," Just go without us, we'll be there in five minutes."," Ha ha ha ha. Look, are we going or not?  Really?"
Barney, Yes.," Really?  All right, going down to the bar and ordering three beers, I'll see you in five minutes."
Barney," So many questions. Firstly, what do you think would happen if a guy walked into that store wearing a suit of boots?"," You just made the list, bitch.  You look fantastic in them, Robin. But don't you think they're a little high for that dress?"
Barney," FYI, it doesn't matter, baby. Guys just wanna get on the green. They don't mind going through the rough."," Oh, that's the point. It's to hide the point that I haven't shaved my legs. I've g*n a strict no-shave policy for the first three dates. It's all about self-control. If I don't shave, I must behave.  Shekwakie."
Barney, Stinson.," Shekwakie.  All right, the beers are here."
Barney," Yeah, we're not gonna make it."," All right, the beers are here.  Oh come on, we agreed...Did Marshall take his pants off?"
Barney," Yeah, pants are off."," Oh come on, we agreed...Did Marshall take his pants off?  This is Wimbledon, Ted. I need the freedom and mobility that only underwear can provide. Cheerio."
Barney, That's 'cause you distracted me. You've been hanging crumpet ever since the third set.," Kazouwee. Vanquished, old bean.  Stinson."
Barney, Stinson.," That's 'cause you distracted me. You've been hanging crumpet ever since the third set.  I've got a situation. Trudy is here, you know, the pineapple incident."
Barney," You mean, the girl who chalked your pool cue and snuck down the f*re escape."," I've got a situation. Trudy is here, you know, the pineapple incident.  So, we're hitting it off and then her friend shows up and they're kinda competitive."
Barney, So you now have two on the line?," So, we're hitting it off and then her friend shows up and they're kinda competitive.  And I don't know which one to go for."
Barney, Go for the new girl.," And I don't know which one to go for.  Given the choice, always party with Dr. Strangelove."
Barney," Given the choice, always party with Dr. Strangelove.", Go for the new girl.  New girl? What new girl?
Barney, Two girls are allegedly vying for Ted's affections and I think...," New girl? What new girl?  Oh, you don't know what you're talking about. Give it to me."
Barney," That's what I thought about your bangers and mash down there but I guess we're both wrong, governor."," I thought we were in for the evening.  Oh, Ted, OK, settle an argument. Is it stealing if you go out with someone's boyfriend after they've broken up?"
Barney," No way, no way, no way!", It's a tricycle.  What's happening?
Barney, Put him on speaker.," Well, I'll just say it right now, all sorority girls are sluts.  So what you're saying to us right now is you have a sh*t at the belt?"
Barney, So what you're saying to us right now is you have a sh*t at the belt?," Put him on speaker.  Wait wait wait, what belt?"
Barney, Behold.," Oh, so it's a metaphorical belt, right?  You actually bought a belt."
Barney," That's right, it's resplendent."," You actually bought a belt.  It's just a thing we said, we were kidding around."
Barney," I never kid. Remember you said if I ever slept with that girl from Days of our Lives, I'd be the king? Well..."," It's just a thing we said, we were kidding around.  Why wasn't I told about the belt? I could go for the belt."
Barney," All right, Ted, if you're about to go for the belt, then the bylaws require me to ask the following questions. One, is the aggregate age of all the participants under 83?"," Guys, come on, help me out. What do I do?  Yes."
Barney," Two, is the aggregate weight of all participants under 400 pounds.", Yes.  Yes.
Barney," Theodore Mosby, are you paying these women?", Yes.  What? No.
Barney, Ted?," What? No.  No. Look, I gotta go. They're gonna think I inherited my dad's imaginary bathroom issues."
Barney," Oh, hold on. Ted's texting me. (reading text) We're combing upsars."," No, but fifty will.  We're combing upsars? What does that mean?"
Barney, I cannot allow Ted to do this.," What are you doing?  Why, why?"
Barney, Because the belt is my birthright. You can't claim it before I do. That would be like Jimmy Olsen capturing Lex Luther while Superman watches impotently from the bedroom.," Why, why?  But Barney, you've done way dirtier stuff than Ted. You're disgusting."
Barney," I've never ridden the tricycle. I was on the verge last year, it was so close."," But Barney, you've done way dirtier stuff than Ted. You're disgusting.  So, ladies, why don't we move this party to a more horizontal location?"
Barney," So, ladies, why don't we move this party to a more horizontal location?"," I've never ridden the tricycle. I was on the verge last year, it was so close.  Oh my God. My new carpet. Oh my God, this is a disaster, You get the carpet cleaner, I'll get a towel."
Barney, I'll get the video camera., OK.  Get out!
Barney, OK then., Get out!  Let me get this straight. You're gonna trike block me? That is so petty. It's like you're...
Barney, Oh my God., Wish me luck.  Where's the shaving cream?
Barney, Leave him alone! Sometimes even the greatest warriors sh**t themselves in the foot.," Ted, you're ruining this for everyone.  What are you talking about? Barney: If you must know, it wasn't a freak beverage malfunction that stopped me from riding the tricycle that night."
Barney," Oh no, the night's ruined!"," So, Barney, why don't we take this party to a more horizontal location?  No, baby, it's not."
Barney, Yes it is. Whatever this night was heading towards is ruined. Where's my coat?," No, baby, it's not.  Why would you do that to yourself?"
Barney," Because you get up in your head, man. Start thinking, I can't do this. It's two women. That's two of everything, four of some things. The logistics alone are enough to cripple even a pro like me."," Why would you do that to yourself?  See? If a complete degenerate like Barney choked, what chance do I have?"
Barney," The best chance in the world. Fear took the belt from me. Fear rode the tricycle that night, my friends. But fear will not get a second turn."," See? If a complete degenerate like Barney choked, what chance do I have?  It won't?"
Barney," No, because I now realize it isn't my destiny to win the belt. It is my destiny to help my friend win it. Ted is fated to go there first. He is our Neil Armstrong. (laughs) Space-suit-up, Ted, 'cause you're going to the moon. Step 1."," It won't?  Ladies, couldn't find your coats but I did find tequila."
Barney," Right, that's my apartment. Dressing gown's mine too. Damn, this should be me."," Wait, wait wait, a remote control f*re place? We don't have a remote control f*re place.  I am so exhausted."
Barney, That's your excuse to unleash pretext for physical contact number one., Why would I want to tire them out?  You give the most amazing foot massage.
Barney," It's endearing, you're a caregiver. Never take family values out of the equation."," Why in God's name would I say that?  Ted, what's wrong?"
Barney," OK, wait for it."," OK, what the hell.  Could happen at any time and obliterate all life on earth, which is why I live by three simple words. Don't postpone joy."
Barney, Yes you can.," Mortality angle, that's actually pretty good. I can do this.  I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I'm actually moved. Bring it in, guys."
Barney," So, what happened next? Did you do it? Ted: Doesn't seem right to talk about it.", I'll see you on the other side.  What? No! Tell me. Don't tell me because you don't have to because you didn't do it.
Barney, What? No! Tell me. Don't tell me because you don't have to because you didn't do it.," So, what happened next? Did you do it? Ted: Doesn't seem right to talk about it.  You didn't do it. You did it. You did it, didn't you? Did you?"

Barney, Did? Tell me. You know if he did it?, Did you? Did you? Or didn't you?  Oh hey. Will you go in there and see if my date's OK?
Barney, She's totally hot and really fun., What do you mean? Ted: When someone wants to set you up they always tell you the good qualities first but then they leave out their huge flaw.  (to himself) But she has a d*ad tooth.
Barney, (to himself) But she has a d*ad tooth., She's totally hot and really fun.  She's superhot and she's so successful.
Barney," If memory serves me, she had a huge 'but'. Her huge butt. Nailed it!"," Hey, you know what, not every setup has a 'but'. What about, um, Jamie, that girl that Lily set you up with? She was really nice.  Well, there's nothing wrong with this guy. He's really nice and he's really cute."
Barney, g*n.," I like sports cars but it doesn't mean I wanna push a Ferrari through my vagina  You can't blame us for thinking that the kid would be a problem. I mean, if we were friends with Garfield, we wouldn't set him up on a date with Mondays."
Barney, Nice.," You can't blame us for thinking that the kid would be a problem. I mean, if we were friends with Garfield, we wouldn't set him up on a date with Mondays.  You know what, the kid is not a problem. I wanna meet this guy."
Barney, (to himself) But she's Canadian., (to herself) But she's a g*n nut.  (to himself) But she didn't like Field of Dreams.

Barney," OK, I've got it. Here, put on this eye patch.", You don't have a 'but'.  Why?
Barney, The ultimate ice breaker.," Why?  A bunch of cobras got loose in Central Park. You and I are jogging, training for the Death Valley Iron Man. No big deal, we do it every year.

Barney, They're different eyes. I don't see why this bugs you. Patch up!," Both of us.  So, Robin went on a date with George, the guy with the kid. And afterwards..."
Barney," I'm going out, buying eye patches. What are you doing to help score chicks?"," Don't tell anyone I said that.  OK, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. People with real game don't need eye patches."
Barney," Oh, Theodore..."," OK, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. People with real game don't need eye patches. ...no no no, you can't spell game without me, and me has the best game."
Barney,"...no no no, you can't spell game without me, and me has the best game."," Oh, Theodore...  Yeah, well, I got so much game, I'm Cornish game hen."

Barney, Wow.," Well, I'm The Game, well-crafted, keep-you-guessing thriller starring Michael Douglas and Sean Penn.  Wow. You're here and not in stall two."
Barney," OK, Marshall.", I may have made some wildly inappropriate h*m* comments to a gentleman wearing your shoes.  Yes.
Barney, Which one of us has more game?," Yes.  Neither of you guys has any game, right, or else you'd be married like me."
Barney," What? Marshall: If dating is the game, then marriage is winning the game."," Neither of you guys has any game, right, or else you'd be married like me.  Yeah, if you're playing in the women's league."
Barney," OK. One, we agreed not to ever say 'bra' anymore. It was a good week, we had a lot of fun, but it's over. Two, you've been with Lily for eleven years. You're idea of good game is slapping on a Dr. Seuss hat and flashing two tickets to a Spin Doctors concert."," You're joking. I have mad game, bra.  I hate to say it, buddy, but you're kinda' irrelevant."
Barney," Ted, you do not have more game than me. By sheer numbers alone, I win. Come on, dude, you've seen my list.", What? I am not irrelevant. I know tons of stuff. I could help you guys. I don't wanna be left out.  Do you guys wanna hear one of my lines?
Barney," Ted, I challenge you to a picking-up-girls Olympiad.", Are you a model? That one's good because it's flattering to the girl.  Fine.
Barney, There will be 26 events spread out over 11 weeks. We will travel to a neutral city where a panel of international judges..., Fine.  Or we could just choose a girl and the first one to seal the deal wins.
Barney, That's good too., Or we could just choose a girl and the first one to seal the deal wins.  How about her?
Barney, How about her?, That's good too.  You're on.
Barney," Before we start, why don't we jot down a few basic ground rules?"," You're on.  OK, great. Rule number one, no eye patches or props of any kind."
Barney, I win.," Rule number two, this bet is for one million dollars.  How?"
Barney," Oh, I slept with her, about a year ago, I just forgot."," How?  Oh, well, that doesn't count. The bet started the moment we shook."
Barney, I can't sleep with her again. She hates me.," Oh, well, that doesn't count. The bet started the moment we shook.  Oh, Interesting. Look who just took a commanding lead. Now, with you out of the picture, I can take my sweet time."
Barney," By the look of those shoes, here comes your bathroom buddy.", Get out of my way.  Look who's got game.
Barney," Whatever, Ted."," You see this. Game face.  Oh, get this, she plays bass in a reggae band. They're having a show this Friday. How cool is that?"
Barney," Oh, does she know that one song? Mm-hm chaka, mm-hm chaka. What's that song called? Oh, right, it's called every reggae song."," Oh, get this, she plays bass in a reggae band.

Barney, Doesn't count.," One thousand fifty-three and a half times...my mom called once. But that's more times than Barney has ever had sex and to your point, Ted, Lily is a quality girl. I win. Lawyered.  Totally counts."
Barney," OK, Ted, go win the bet. You have my blessing. She's a wonderful girl. I should know."," You're right, it counts. It counts as one. You've had sex once. How was it? Marshall: I still matter.  Oh, OK, OK, I see what you're doing."
Barney," We've never shared a woman, have we, Ted? Isn't that funny? You're with her now, I was with her a year ago. You figure for her, that's like 200 showers ago. You gotta ask yourself, Ted, is 200 enough? Ted: You know what, I don't mind. Barney: No, of course you don't mind. Just like the second guy to climb Mt. Everest didn't mind getting all the way to the top only to find Sir Edmund Hilary's flagpole thrust into its supple peak."," Oh, OK, OK, I see what you're doing.  No, I'm sure when you're with her I'll be the furthest thing from your mind. Kissing what I've already kissed. Nuzzling what I've already nuzzled.

Barney, I'm not afraid of catching your cooties, OK?"
Barney," Really? Ted's not afraid of cooties. OK, well then I guess you'd have no problem having a sip of my gin and tonic."," Barney, I'm not afraid of catching your cooties, OK?  Fine."
Barney, And I only stirred that with my pinky.," Fine.  Guess who loves Robin? Kids, kids love Robin. Doug thinks I'm pretty cool."

Barney," From this spot, I also launched an expedition to those two large ridges down there."," Hey, Ted, pucker up all you want but I was here first.  Uh, Ted, something wrong?"
Barney, That's what you think happened.," What do you mean, win? You couldn't even talk to her. You tried, you got slapped.  OK, great, rule number one no eye patches or props of any..."
Barney, Here's the deal. My friend just got dumped so he's a little shy but he'd love to buy you a drink and get to know you. The problem is he thinks a pretty girl like you won't go for a guy like him. So would you slap me across the face so he could see you're not into guys who feed you lines? What do you say? For my friend?," OK, great, rule number one no eye patches or props of any...  You are so sweet."
Barney," So now, whatever nice things Ted does for her, in her mind, I'm the guy who's even nicer than him.", You are so sweet.  So you never slept with her?
Barney, Not even at all.," So you never slept with her?  Wow, that's good."

Barney, Well?," Well., have fun in yoga  Oh."
Barney, Oh., Well?  I'm sorry.
Barney," Stacy, right?"," I'm sorry.  Yeah. Oh, you're Ted's friend from the bar?"
Barney," Yeah, wait, don't tell me you go to yoga here too?"," Yeah. Oh, you're Ted's friend from the bar?  I do."
Barney, She plays bass in a reggae band., I do.  I'm gonna head out to a reggae concert. I'm a huge fan of reggae.
Barney, I'm gonna head out to a reggae concert. I'm a huge fan of reggae.," She plays bass in a reggae band.  Oh my gosh, I play in a reggae band."

Barney," Hey, stace. What happened? He did not. Stay there, I'll be right over."," Hold one, hold on a second. Stacy.  I should have just worn that stupid eye patch."
Barney," That's what makes you so special, baby."," You know, I really appreciate how cool you've been about us taking things slow.  Anyway, I am so psyched to be playing Sun Splash tomorrow. We go on sometime between 11 and 6 so you probably wanna get there before nine to be safe. Oh, and it's gonna be muddy."
Barney," So, she's hot."," Oh, there's a stigma. That's why people always say there's no stigma anymore.  Oh, she's gorgeous."
Barney, Then she's crazy.," Oh, she's gorgeous.  No she's not."
Barney," Ted, the only hot girls that troll the Internet for dudes are crazy, hookers or dudes."," No she's not.  OK, she's not crazy, she's not a hooker, she's not a dude. Though there's this guy I pass on my work every day who's all three, scares the crap out of me."

Barney, I should give her a call.,"... then get a boob job.  OK, so please, just play along with her fake story. We met in a cooking class."
Barney," I don't know, Ted, I don't know if I can just play along with your crazy girlfriend's fake story. Now, if you had said fake breasts..."," OK, so please, just play along with her fake story. We met in a cooking class.  She's not crazy."

Barney," Well, we're closing in on the half. Let's see how Blah-blah's doing on the crazy-hot scale."," Come on, blah-blah, it's not like that.  She started the night here"
Barney, She started the night here," Well, we're closing in on the half. Let's see how Blah-blah's doing on the crazy-hot scale.

Barney," Yes, yes, pep talk. You can do this, but to be more accurate, you probably can't. You're way out of practice and she is way too hot for you.

Barney," Ted, Ted, Ted, guy in the hat! Three stripes, ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ted Mosby, p*rn star.", Apparently you can.  I know what kind of plane this is. It's a boing.
Barney," See, this is way better than Marshall's intership.", I know what kind of plane this is. It's a boing.  It's a real job.
Barney, More around the eyes.," Oh yeah. A little bit. Yeah.  Oh, I do see that."
Barney," Hmm. You're not wrong. (He looks on his phone) According to the web site, of the far superior Ted Mosby... he's been in the business three months, and he's made 125 movies."," Ah, ah, very funny, Wendy. Now we know you watch p*rn. (She leaves) This Ted Mosby must be getting kind of famous.  Wow. That's 42 movies a month. Who is he, Jude Law? Right? He makes a lot of movies. I mean, not so much lately, but maybe, like, two years ago, you couldn't go to a movie without..."
Barney," Oh, he is good. Classic seduction technique."," I'm sorry. Stop. I can't do this with a straight face. You don't want to work here. You're only here 'cause your dad went to high school with Joe Hewitt. Fact is, you just got a sweet job at the NRDC. And it's awesome. Man, I could have gone the non-profit route. I didn't. And it eats me up inside every day. I hate myself. I hate myself.  What do you mean?"
Barney," Oh, I use it all the time. First I buy her... and by her I mean you... a drink. Now, I'm the guy who gets her what she wants. Then I pretend to care about whatever idiotic thing she cares about. For you, that would be the enviroment. Now, I'm the great guy who shares her interests. And before you know it, you're naked in my apartment, shouting oh-oh Bar-r-r-ne-e-y! And by you, I mean her.", What do you mean?  He is not trying to seduce me. He didn't even offer me the job.
Barney," That comes later. At dinner. He did invite you to dinner, didn't he?"," He is not trying to seduce me. He didn't even offer me the job.  Let me buy you a dinner. Tomorrow night. As a thank you, okay? You'll tell me all about the NRDC, and we'll charge it all to one of my evil clients."
Barney, Don't wait up.," Oh, you should go. I mean, you're not gonna take the job, but you might as well get a great meal out of the deal.  Guys, guys, guys, check this out. Ted Mosby p*rn star's bio says his hometown is your hometown. Shaker Heights, Ohio."
Barney, Affirmative. Or to put in another way... God bless America.," Hmm. Wait, are you telling me that they actually have conventions for p*rn?  You can really taste the beef in that lobster."
Barney, No way! March does not have 31 days.," Back when we were dating robin and I had this running joke. We were the only two people in the world who found it funny.  Yes, it does! Everyone knows that. It's like general knowledge."
Barney, I gotta go.," But most importantly, you can never, ever be alone together.  I'm gonna go pay."
Barney, What?," Yeah, this is gonna be the best Slapsgiving ever.  I said this is going to be the best Thanksgiving ever."
Barney," I'm sorry. Did you just say Canadian Thanksgiving was and I'm quoting,the real Thanksgiving? What do Canadians even have to celebrate about?"," I'm sorry,sometimes I forget how seriously you guys take American Thanksgiving. Real thanksgiving happened over a month ago.  Canadian Thanksgiving celebrates explorer martin frobisher's valiant yet ultimately unsuccessful attempt to find the northwest passage."
Barney, Why are you guys even a country?," Canadian Thanksgiving celebrates explorer martin frobisher's valiant yet ultimately unsuccessful attempt to find the northwest passage.  Oh, hey, by the way, if anyone wants to come over early thursday, we can watch the Slapsgiving day parade."
Barney," Well, there, you said it again."," Oh, hey, by the way, if anyone wants to come over early thursday, we can watch the Slapsgiving day parade.  Said what?"
Barney, Slapsgiving.," Said what?  Oh, I guess I did. You know why? I've invented a new holiday: Slapsgiving. It's the one day we set aside each year to gather together and give slaps."
Barney, slapcountdown.com.," I should explain. Kids, you remember the slap bet a year earlier, Marshall made a bet with Barney and won the right to slap him five times. He had already used the first and the second. But Marshall had something special in store for the third.  no."
Barney, no.," slapcountdown.com.  No, no. The countdown ends at 3:00 p.m., the day after Thanksgiving. I counted it out."
Barney," No, no. The countdown ends at 3:00 p.m., the day after Thanksgiving. I counted it out.", no.  How many days are in october?
Barney," Uh, thirty."," How many days are in october?  Dude, I thought we cleared this up last year."
Barney, I like Halloween very much. Is nice.," Dude, I thought we cleared this up last year.  Is also tomorrow."
Barney, Damn it!," Is also tomorrow.  Wait, you're gonna slap me on Thanksgiving?"
Barney," Wait, you're gonna slap me on Thanksgiving?", Damn it!  Slapsgiving.
Barney," That's not allowed. Lily, you're the slap bet commissioner, is that allowed?"," Slapsgiving.  The hostess in me who's using her wedding china for the first time wants to say hell, no, but yeah, I 'm going to allow it."
Barney," Well, you know what? If you're trying to freak me out about spending Thanksgiving..."," The hostess in me who's using her wedding china for the first time wants to say hell, no, but yeah, I 'm going to allow it.  Slapsgiving."
Barney,"...at your place, then you failed. Truth is, I'm not scared.", Slapsgiving.  Really?
Barney," Right. Cause you blew it. The worst part about getting slapped is not knowing when it's going to happen. But now I know exactly when I'm gonna get slapped. So, you took all the suspense out. You showed your hand."," Really?  And thursday at 3:01 p.m., your face is going to show my hand."
Barney, Nothing but respect for that man.," How are you guys not seeing this? He's 150; Robin's 27. Barney, come on,what do you got?  Oh, by the way, we're all baking pies at robin's tomorrow. Marshall can't be trusted in the apartment with pies overnight."
Barney," Yeah, I'll be there, absolutely."," I'm going to make a phone call.(On the phone with Barney who is at the Bar)Hey, it's me. listen, you have to come over here and make pies.  Oh, awesome, you're a lifesaver. It's still kind of weird being alone with Robin, but if you were here..."
Barney," Hey, say no more. I mean, when I pulled you out of that burning wreckage, I wasn't doing it to have a battleship named after me. But if you insist, yes, I'll be there for the christening."," Oh, awesome, you're a lifesaver. It's still kind of weird being alone with Robin, but if you were here...  You're hitting on someone right now, aren't you?"
Barney," No, I'm not going to wear the medal of honor. That would just be tacky."," You're hitting on someone right now, aren't you?  So you're not coming to make pies."
Barney," No, no. Thank you, mr. President.(He hungs up)Sorry."," So you're not coming to make pies.  After a very long night, it was finally the big holiday. Sorry, the two big holidays."
Barney," Please, you took out all the suspense. In a horror movie, the k*ller does not grab a bullhorn and announce, Attention unsupervised teens here at the lake house: at precisely 3:00 a.m., I'm gonna jump out of that closet right there and hack you all up with a machete. P.S. f*re is my one weakness."," In a minute, baby. I've only got so many hands. You see what I got going on here? They're turkeys, but they're also hands, because later, we're going to eat turkey... and then i'm going to slap you in your face.  Hey, ted."
Barney," Exactly. And you know why? Because you don't want to hurt someone you really care about, especially around the holidays. I mean, what decent human being would want to cause any kind of emotional or physical pain..."," I mean, you can't talk about how close you used to be. You can't talk about how close you're not now. You just feel like everything you say is gonna make things worse.  You're still getting slapped."
Barney, Ooh. terrible.," Remember last year's Thanksgiving, when we had sex seven times?  What?! I thought it would break the ice."
Barney, She's got you making pies for this guy?, Yeah.  Yeah.
Barney, You guys slept together last night?," me, too.  That is a terrible idea!"
Barney," Relapse five! That's where we high-five, then it's awkward for a little bit... and then we high-five again!", Horrible idea.  What the hell were you doing? Let's review: you and Ted broke up six months ago. You're dating another man...
Barney," Um, most Thanksgivings."," You know what? That's it! This is Thanksgiving. Solve this right now. And if you have sex again, neither of you gets dessert! Oh, what the hell kind of Thanksgiving is this anyway?  Don't stress, baby. I'll try to find us something relaxing."
Barney, I'm not scared.," Oh, my! Look at that. That means we're in the final hour of the countdown.  Then why is your right cheek twitching? It's not... maybe it's because future me slaps future you so hard, it reverberates back to the present, shattering the time-slap continuum."
Barney, Please don't slap me.," Then why is your right cheek twitching? It's not... maybe it's because future me slaps future you so hard, it reverberates back to the present, shattering the time-slap continuum.  I'm sorry, what?"
Barney," Oh, God! don't slap me again! I don't want to get slapped again, and the first two times hurt so bad, I don't like it! I don't like it one bit!"," I'm sorry, what?  I thought I ruined it by putting a clock on it, Barney?"
Barney," Well, you didn't ruin it; you made it so much worse! I can't eat. I can't sleep. I've lost ten pounds; my suits are wearing me. You know what? I'm outta here."," I thought I ruined it by putting a clock on it, Barney?  Well, no, no, no. you can't leave."
Barney," Why can't I?! Nowhere in the rules does it say that I have to sit through sort of mental t*rture! You are allowed to slap my face, Sir, but you are not allowed to slap my mind! Good day!"," Well, no, no, no. you can't leave.  But it's Slapsgiving."
Barney, Yes! In your face! Not my face... your face!," What?!  What's up, dudes?"
Barney," Marshall, you're not eating. Did something spoil your slap-petite?"," So we sat down to our first Thanksgiving together as a group...and, apparently, our last.  No, i just thought...before we eat, maybe the chef would like to say a few words."
Barney, I thought we were done with that?," Oh, no...  I guess we're not."
Barney," Hey, check it out! We're in the last 20 seconds of Marshall's countdown to nothing."," You see kids, friendship is an involuntary reflex... It just happens,you can't help it. That first Thanksgiving turned out to be a wonderful dinner with the four people I love most in the world... and Bob and it did become a tradition. That's why every year,we go to aunt Lily and uncle Marshall's for Thanksgiving.  Barney, put it away."
Barney," How does it feel, Marshall,to sit there, impotently... your large, flaccid hand,just dangling in the wind?"," Barney, put it away.  The slap will occur in ten.."
Barney," Ooh, classy touch, dude. Too bad!"," The slap will occur in ten..  Barney, put it away."
Barney, I will in... five...,"...six... ... five, four..."
Barney," What?! Wait, you...",...three... ...two...one.
Barney," oh, that's not a tattoo. That, dear boy, is a tramp stamp!", I have a tattoo!  a tramp stamp?!
Barney, what?, Dr Stella Zinman. She's the best in the business. And she's rather cute in fact. In fact... we're going to a movie together tonight.  I asked her out.
Barney, what's matter with you?," Ted, why would you do that?  What? What do you mean?"
Barney, Dude... don't poop where you eat.," What? What do you mean?  oh, no, this doesn't count."
Barney," You've heard of the golden rule, right? love their neighbor?"," and in this case, you're paying them... then yes, it counts.  uh, actually, it's do unto others as you would have them do unto you. It's from the bible."
Barney," Damn it Ted, i've worked out this whole thing where the golden rule is love thy neighbor, ok?... Now the golden rule is love thy neigbor. But, there's one rule above it: the platinum rule: never ever, ever, ever, love thy neighbor."," uh, actually, it's do unto others as you would have them do unto you. It's from the bible.  Well, that's cute. But she's not my neighbor, she's my doctor. So if you'll excuse me..."
Barney, Need i remind you about me and Wendy the waitress?," Oh, yeah, and remember what happened with us and the gerards across the hall?  yeah, i don't have time for this. I'm out the door as soon as i'm finished with my hair."
Barney," good, then we've got a solid half hour. And in that time, we will convince you not to set foot out that door. It's a story older than time, my friend, and it always plays out in the same eight steps. Step 1: Attraction."," yeah, i don't have time for this. I'm out the door as soon as i'm finished with my hair.  It's true."
Barney, It's true.," good, then we've got a solid half hour. And in that time, we will convince you not to set foot out that door. It's a story older than time, my friend, and it always plays out in the same eight steps. Step 1: Attraction.  That's not even possible."
Barney, 12 of them., That's not even possible.  There's no way.
Barney, Thanks.," Here's your gin and tonic.  O gosh! Look at that. (She leaves scrubing a stain in her shirt, Barney starves at her with interest)"
Barney, The attraction is instant and undeniable.," Hockey.  But you know better. You've seen your friends make the same mistakes before. You've laughed smugly at them.(laughs) Idiots! But still, you think, this is different. The platinum rule doesn't apply to me. And that step 2! Bargaining."
Barney," But you know better. You've seen your friends make the same mistakes before. You've laughed smugly at them.(laughs) Idiots! But still, you think, this is different. The platinum rule doesn't apply to me. And that step 2! Bargaining.", The attraction is instant and undeniable.  I think i've got a little crush on our sports guy.
Barney, That's the couples version of dating.," we're not gonna date them. We're just gonna be friends with them.  And you've got the couples version of the hots for them. Oh, yeah, you want to browse at pottery barn with them. You want to go antiquing with them, don't you? Oh, yeah, you want to antique the crap out of them."
Barney, Need i remind you what happened with me and Wendy the waitress?," And you've got the couples version of the hots for them. Oh, yeah, you want to browse at pottery barn with them. You want to go antiquing with them, don't you? Oh, yeah, you want to antique the crap out of them.  I've decided to seduce Wendy the waitress."
Barney, I've decided to seduce Wendy the waitress., Need i remind you what happened with me and Wendy the waitress?  No! Don't do it!
Barney, Request denied! What rule is there that say's i can't seduce the waitress at my favorite bar?, No! Don't do it!  I don't know. I'd expect you to have one already.
Barney," Well, i don't. I don't have one and i never will be because it's a great idea. Come on, guys! She's gullible. I'm bored. We're perfect for each other."," Yeah, with some sort of catchy name.  Barney, we love this bar. If you screxw over Wendy the waitress, you're going to k*ll the bar."
Barney," yeah, well... I think it'll be okay."," Don't k*ll the bar, dude.  And it was a huge mistake."
Barney, And it was a huge mistake.," yeah, well... I think it'll be okay.  yeah, well, i think it'll be okay."
Barney," Ted, trust me. You don't want to do this."," yeah, well... I think it'll be okay.  Look, Stella and i are adults; we're both smart, mature people capable of making good decisions."
Barney, That's what everyone thinks and then along comes step 3: Submission.," We're just seeing a movie. If it seems at all weird, i'll back off.  Good night!"
Barney, Good night!, That's what everyone thinks and then along comes step 3: Submission.  Hey Barney! Carl had to take off. You mind giving me a hand?
Barney, Not at all., Hey Barney! Carl had to take off. You mind giving me a hand?  Robin! I got 2 tickets to the rangers. Center ice. Want to go?
Barney, Club soda can get anything off.," That was an intersting use of the beverage g*n.  It finally happened, all this time, every drink i brought you... I always felt there was this unspoken connection between us. And i was right!"
Barney," hey, can i get a gin and tonic?"," It finally happened, all this time, every drink i brought you... I always felt there was this unspoken connection between us. And i was right!  See, i bet you didn't pay for that gin and tonic."
Barney," oh, i paid for it."," See, i bet you didn't pay for that gin and tonic.  But you got to admit, there is an upside to breaking the platinum rule. Like maybe as her boyfrien, i could get a discount on treatments."
Barney," Oh, Ted, of course there's an upside. At first, that's step 4: Perks."," But you got to admit, there is an upside to breaking the platinum rule. Like maybe as her boyfrien, i could get a discount on treatments.  we can split a cab to work together. We always have a standing lunch date. And last night, at the hockey game, Curt got us into the locker room, and i met Mason Raymond. Left wing for the Vancouver canucks."
Barney, What the opposite of name-dropping?," we can split a cab to work together. We always have a standing lunch date. And last night, at the hockey game, Curt got us into the locker room, and i met Mason Raymond. Left wing for the Vancouver canucks.  Damn it you guys, be psyched. Yes, we see each other every day, but i think it's going really well."
Barney, you just go across the hall? (Marshall agreed)," Say we want to play a game of charades...  Come on people, get excited for us! We've got a great thing going here."
Barney, That's what i thought.," Come on people, get excited for us! We've got a great thing going here.  Dude, you got to flick it."
Barney, you don't have... (Wendy the waitress comes and serves food to Barney)," Dude, you got to flick it.  Hi, sweetie. I had the kitchen whip these up, no charge. (They kiss) Okay. Bye. I mean, not bye. I'm not leaving. I'll be over there. okay. (She leaves)"
Barney," Come on, guys, free nachos. What?"," Hi, sweetie. I had the kitchen whip these up, no charge. (They kiss) Okay. Bye. I mean, not bye. I'm not leaving. I'll be over there. okay. (She leaves)  We like this bar."
Barney," I'm not k*lling the bar. Wendy the waitress has seen how i operate in this place. It is perfectly clear to everyone involved that this is nothing more than a temporary fling. (Wendy starves him, lovely) It's fiiine.", You're k*lling the bar.  But it wasn't.
Barney, But it wasn't.," I'm not k*lling the bar. Wendy the waitress has seen how i operate in this place. It is perfectly clear to everyone involved that this is nothing more than a temporary fling. (Wendy starves him, lovely) It's fiiine.  It's fine."
Barney, Which brings us to step 5: THE TIPPING POINT.[TITLE:THE TIPPING POINT- set of metro news 1- Curt/Robin]," But it wasn't. ...but he should be back on the mound by spring training and that's sport. Back to you, Robin."
Barney," hey, Wendy, uh, do me a favor and send a glass of champagne to that pretty young girl over there."," on my suggestion, you... (Barney looks at a girl)  What? (Ted and Marshall starve Barney, anxious)"
Barney, over there... YOU... you're the pretty young thing...is what i meant. Champagne? Would you? on me.," What? (Ted and Marshall starve Barney, anxious)  Oh, okay, thanks sweetie. (She kisses him)"
Barney, okay. All right.," Oh, okay, thanks sweetie. (She kisses him)  hey, neighbors."
Barney, which brings to step 6.," Oh no!  Yeah, listen i'm leaving so if you want to write the rest of these down, i will read it tomorrow."
Barney, Don't do this Ted.," Yeah, listen i'm leaving so if you want to write the rest of these down, i will read it tomorrow.  You want to get out of the way?"
Barney, Which brings us to step 6. You finally realize you've made a huge mistake and now you have to live with it. Step 6 is called purg... wait for it. Keep waiting. Keep waiting for the eternity only to dicover there's no escap-atory.," Dude! ya! It was perfect! You're such a jerk!  God, i'm such an idiot."
Barney, Yeah!," Ro! we are such idiots!  Every time we step out the door, they're out there waiting for us. Sometimes, we'll send Ted out first as a scout. Nobody's there. Then we'll go out one second later, and there they are."
Barney, I remember that.," Hey neighbor! Hey, neighborHey neighbor.  How could you guys let me date Wendy the waitress?"
Barney, How could you guys let me date Wendy the waitress?, I remember that.  oh you are kidding me?! What?!
Barney," tss (He looks at a girl but Wendy is right behind, she smiles, he looks desperate)"," We said don't do it!  You've got a whole meat locker at home full of corpses, don't you?"
Barney," Now look at me. Declawed. Neutered. What was once my jungle is now my zoo and i am forced to mate with the same old lioness again, and again, and again while families pay to watch."," You've got a whole meat locker at home full of corpses, don't you?  yeah, this metaphor's really falling apart."
Barney," Put a bell around my neck and scratch my belly kids, for i am just a docile housecat now. Miaou!"," yeah, this metaphor's really falling apart.  Well, we love this bar. You can't dump her. Marry her if you have to."
Barney," And so, inevitably, you have to do the thing you've been dreading all along. Now, a relationship-ectomy is a delicate surgery as it is, but in the case of the platinum rule, it takes a very, very steady hand, and that's step 7: CONFRONTATION."," don't k*ll the bar dude.  Curt, we need to talk. I like you..."
Barney, I don't like you.," guys, we like you a lot...  We're pretending this works, but it doesn't. And i'm getting a little sick of the whole charade."
Barney," I mean, i don't like you that way. I used to like you that way but now that i've seen everything there is to see, i don't know, i kind of want to see those same parts just on other girls.", We're getting a little sick of charades.  So maybe we could go back to just being coworkers.
Barney," other girls and you, if you're into that but the other girls have to be there, too. That's the important part."," Maybe we should just go back to being neighbors.  Gosh, you're just terrified of ever getting close to anyone, aren't you?"
Barney, or that. Let's say it's that. So can i get a gin and tonic?," Gosh, you're just terrified of ever getting close to anyone, aren't you?  And in any other relationship, that would be it. End of story. But because you have to see this person again, there's a step 8: FALLOUT."
Barney," And in any other relationship, that would be it. End of story. But because you have to see this person again, there's a step 8: FALLOUT."," or that. Let's say it's that. So can i get a gin and tonic?  And now, here's Curt the iron man irons with sports. Curt? (he's demoralized) Curt?"
Barney, Thanks Wendy. Of course we can.," Barney, i just want you to know, i have no hard feelings. It wasn't the best idea for us to get involved. I hope we can still be friends.  If you need anything else, let me know."
Barney, She's gonna try to k*ll me. This is poisoned., waouh. I've got to hand it to Wendy the waitress that was very mature of her.  What? You're being ridiculous.
Barney, Yours is poisoned too. She's trying to k*ll me and everyone close to me., What? You're being ridiculous.  What are you talking about?
Barney, Ted! Look at the facts. I dump her and she says no hard feelings. She's a psycho! What other explanation is there?," What are you talking about?  Uh, that you're letting yourself believe she's crazy so you don't have to face the far more likely possibility that she doesn't want to date you either?"
Barney, Where did Marshall get that hamburger?," Uh, that you're letting yourself believe she's crazy so you don't have to face the far more likely possibility that she doesn't want to date you either?  I don't know, i guess Wendy the Waitress brought it to him."
Barney, Noooooooo! (He throws his hamburger away)," I don't know, i guess Wendy the Waitress brought it to him.  Dude."
Barney, You're welcome.," Dude.  Wait a second. You've been sitting here, pretending to be the expert on all this, but the truth is, this was no real fallout from your breakup at all?"
Barney, Yet.," Wait a second. You've been sitting here, pretending to be the expert on all this, but the truth is, this was no real fallout from your breakup at all?  You're an idiot."
Barney, What?," All right, i'm taking off.  I have a date. (Barney brushes Ted's hair in a mess)"
Barney," Ted, have you not been listening? Attraction, bargaining, submission, perks, tipping point, purgatory, confrontation, fallout! These things will all happen to you as surely as they happened to all of us! It's a rule of nature."," You're such a jerk!  Well, i'm sick of all the rules! There's too many of them! The hot/crazy scale, the lemon law, the platinum rule! If everyone in the world followed every one of your rules, the human race would cease to exist. Yes chances are to Stella and I are not going to live happily ever after the overwhelming odds have it ending badly. And when that happens, it'll be for one of a million possible reasons. But that doesn't mean i'm not gonna try. And when it does fail, so help me god, it's not gonna be because of some rule. (He watches himself in th mirror) PS: you just made my hair look awesome. Good night. (He leaves)"
Barney," Exactly, the platinum rule. Stella reads my blog."," Apparently, there's a rule that says i can't date Stella.  No, this rule comes from the american medical association. Doctors aren't legally allowed to date their patients."
Barney, On the house., It just takes a while.  Thanks. (She leaves and he throws the drink) Crazy!
Barney, Thanks. (She leaves and he throws the drink) Crazy!, On the house.
Barney,"There's three rules of cheating: It's not cheating if you're not the one who's married. It's not cheating if her name had two adjacent vowels, and it's not cheating if she's from a different area code."," do bad things, good things happen.  I don't see no ring on this finger."
Barney," Ted, do you know how long it takes a woman to decide whether or not she's going to sleep with a guy? 8.3 seconds. After that, her decision is made. She will not change her mind."," Sloppy Joe, shrimp cocktail and a milk shake.  That's ridiculous."
Barney, Is it? Describe your first 8.3 seconds with Stella., That's ridiculous.  Lower back butterfly tattoo... you're up.
Barney," Really, Ted? You think so? Well, tell me, how did the rest of that session go?"," Give me ten sessions, I'm going to turn that no into a yes.  This is going to hurt a little."
Barney, You juggled? I thought you were trying to impress her.," Still no. What's up with that? I mean, I juggled.  You do magic. How is juggling any lamer than magic?"
Barney, Magic's not lame., You do magic. How is juggling any lamer than magic?  I don't get it. I mean...
Barney, Is this lame?," I don't get it. I mean...  Oh, Barney, no, no. We said no fireballs at the table."
Barney, I..., Barney...  We've talked about this. It's a f*re code violation.
Barney," Yeah, but Ted provoked me."," We've talked about this. It's a f*re code violation.  No, no, you are on a time-out. Go sit over there."
Barney, But...," No, no, you are on a time-out. Go sit over there.  Go!"
Barney," You can't turn a no into a yes, Ted. Can't be done."," I got four sessions left. Ther-There's got to be an angle I'm not seeing.  I don't know, Barney. I mean, sometimes persistence pays off. I said yes eventually."
Barney," No, you didn't. You were like, No, we can't, we're friends. It would mess up the dynamic of the group."," I don't know, Barney. I mean, sometimes persistence pays off. I said yes eventually.  To Ted."
Barney," Oh, right."," To Ted.  Wait a second. Wait a second, I got the angle."
Barney, I like this. Seduce the receptionist. That's a great plan., The receptionist. That's my way in.  That's not the plan. And how would that help me with Stella?
Barney, Who?, That's not the plan. And how would that help me with Stella?  Here's the plan.
Barney," Ted, every little boy wants to grow up to nail the doctor or the lawyer. Somebody's gotta nail the receptionist.", I'm not gonna nail the receptionist.  No. I like Stella.
Barney," Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there, Ted. Your little Stella is not so perfect.", No. I like Stella.  What do you mean?
Barney," I went down there and checked her out for myself. Yeah. And while I was down there, I discovered that she had a secret, a terrible... terrible secret.", What do you mean?  What? What is it?
Barney," Hold on, I gotta pee.(He stands up et goes to the toilets)Okay, I'm back. What's going on at work?", What? What is it?  What's the big secret?!
Barney," Oh. Oh, right."," What's the big secret?!  Hi, I'd like to see Dr. Zinman, please."
Barney," Hi, I'd like to see Dr. Zinman, please."," Oh. Oh, right.  Sure, what's it regarding?"
Barney," Oh, I just want to see her. Want to look at her, see what she looks like."," Sure, what's it regarding?  I-I don't understand."
Barney," I'm sorry, did I accidentally oprima numero dos when I called? Do you speak English? I want to see her!"," I-I don't understand.  Sir, please don't yell at me because when people yell at me, I have a tendency to start crying."
Barney, What are your credentials?!," Sir, please don't yell at me because when people yell at me, I have a tendency to start crying.  Please don't do that. Please."
Barney, I want to know who am I speaking with!(Stella and Ted are coming out of Stella's office)," Please don't do that. Please.  At first she seemed great, beautiful, smart, way out of your league. But then, I overheard this conversation."
Barney," At first she seemed great, beautiful, smart, way out of your league. But then, I overheard this conversation."," I want to know who am I speaking with!(Stella and Ted are coming out of Stella's office)  Oh, Abby, did my hypnotherapist call yet?"
Barney, Folliculaphilia., Folliculaphilia?  What is that?
Barney," Ted, your perfect woman can only be attracted to men with moustaches.", What is that?  That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. That's not real.
Barney," You're right, Ted. I'm just making that up.", That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. That's not real.  I know that you are because there's no such thing.
Barney, Y-you don't remember?, Why? Just why?  I'll bet anyone ten bucks I can get Ted to grow a moustache.
Barney, I'll bet anyone ten bucks I can get Ted to grow a moustache., Y-you don't remember?  Uh... okay.
Barney," I know. I would've done it for free. But, no. You owe me ten bucks."," You sabotaged my next to last chance with Stella for ten dollars?  This is awful. My-my tenth session is next week. I'm gonna ask her out, and she's gonna say the most demoralizing syllable in the English language... no. You know what? Just forget it. I'm not even gonna ask her."
Barney, Wow. This Ted guy sounds like a real jerk. You know your problem? You're too sweet.,...then he just kept toying with my emotions.  Aren't you going to see the doctor about that mole?
Barney," Oh, yeah. Turns out it's just a Raisinet. Hey, how would you like me to take you out to a fancy restaurant and then go on a shopping spree? Treat you the way you should be treated. Would that make you forget about that Ted monster?", Aren't you going to see the doctor about that mole?  My mom was wrong. There are nice guys in New York.
Barney, We just have to go by my hotel room first. My bed was broken. I just have to make sure they fixed it.," My mom was wrong. There are nice guys in New York.  Well, then if it's fixed, can we can have sex on it and then go shopping."
Barney, I like you.," Well, then if it's fixed, can we can have sex on it and then go shopping."
Barney, Your team lost 20 minutes ago.," That's because in the past, we were just guessing. This year, we watched every game, read box scores, tracked injuries. This isn't March Madness. This is March Meticulously Thought-outness.  I didn't know they were playing today."
Barney, Something strange is going on. I was down at the hardware store trying to get a little somethin' somethin'.," You okay, Barney?  Wait. You go to the hardware store to pick up girls?"
Barney, There are four kinds of women who go to the hardware store by themselves., Wait. You go to the hardware store to pick up girls?  Of course there are.
Barney," Single, recently single, recently divorced, lesbian who will let me watch.", Of course there are.  You could not be more evil.
Barney," Sorry. Five. Recently widowed. So, I'm talking to this girl..."," You could not be more evil.  Look, I'm sure he's in a better place. Now let's find you a sturdier ladder."
Barney," Look, I'm sure he's in a better place. Now let's find you a sturdier ladder."," Sorry. Five. Recently widowed. So, I'm talking to this girl...  I was only gone for a second when..."
Barney, I was only gone for a second when...," Look, I'm sure he's in a better place. Now let's find you a sturdier ladder.  See? Skid-proof."
Barney, See? Skid-proof., I was only gone for a second when...  The same thing happened at the pet store yesterday.
Barney, The same thing happened at the pet store yesterday., See? Skid-proof.  Pet store?
Barney," God bless you, Ted. You're reading my blog."," Single girl, mid-twenties, looking for a canine replacement for the boyfriend who just dumped her. Instead, finds Barney.  I'm really bored at work."
Barney," I'd call your ex a dog, but that would be an insult to little Ladybug here."," I'm really bored at work.  Oh, I want to take her home right now."
Barney," Not without a chew toy from Uncle Barney first. And when I got back... I'm sorry,I'm already spoiling her but diamond in the rough... Could your heart just melt?"," Oh, I want to take her home right now.  Jerk!"
Barney," Weird, right? Yeah. The same thing happened last week at the museum."," Jerk!  Ooh, ooh, ooh!"
Barney, Lily.," Ooh, ooh, ooh!  You pretend to be a struggling young artist who needs a new muse."
Barney, No. Marshall., You pretend to be a struggling young artist who needs a new muse.  You're a millionaire art thief casing the joint for a thrill money can no longer give you!
Barney, Oh. No. Robin.," You're a millionaire art thief casing the joint for a thrill money can no longer give you!  You're going blind, and you're trying to soak up all the beauty in the world before the darkness descends."
Barney," Bingo! So, I was talking to this girl..."," You're going blind, and you're trying to soak up all the beauty in the world before the darkness descends.  At this point, about 83%. Soon, these audio guides will be all that I have left."
Barney," At this point, about 83%. Soon, these audio guides will be all that I have left."," Bingo! So, I was talking to this girl...  I'm so sorry."
Barney," My God, you are beautiful. How about I get you a headset so you can see with your ears like I do? I couldn't have been gone more than 20 seconds, but when I came back... Hmm.You know, I also love the smell of great art.", I'm so sorry.  Why does this keep happening?
Barney, Why does this keep happening?," My God, you are beautiful. How about I get you a headset so you can see with your ears like I do? I couldn't have been gone more than 20 seconds, but when I came back... Hmm.You know, I also love the smell of great art.  Maybe you're not as good a liar as you think you are."
Barney," Oh, really? Then why am I not in prison for perjury? But I don't want to talk about work. Something weird is going on here.", Maybe you're not as good a liar as you think you are.  But the next night got even weirder.
Barney, Alan Alda. It was Alan Alda., But the next night got even weirder.  You never gonna believe what just happened.
Barney," Who was that, um, guy from Mash? The main guy. What...? Hawkeye from Mash. How can I be blanking on this?", You never gonna believe what just happened.  Alan Alda?
Barney, No.," Alan Alda?  Hey, a word of advice? That guy you were talking to, Barney Stinson... I know he seems charming, but he's just saying whatever it takes to get in your pants. Sleeping with Barney was the biggest mistake of my life."
Barney," Oh, my God. Where is she?"," Hey, a word of advice? That guy you were talking to, Barney Stinson... I know he seems charming, but he's just saying whatever it takes to get in your pants. Sleeping with Barney was the biggest mistake of my life.  She must have left. She..."
Barney," Well, she-she said I hooked up with her? What was her name? What did she look like?"," She must have left. She...  She didn't say her name, but she had blonde hair, boobs. Kind of trashy."
Barney, d*ad in the eyes with an aura of self-loathing and despair?," She didn't say her name, but she had blonde hair, boobs. Kind of trashy.  Yes!"
Barney," That's all of them. Okay. Stay calm. Let's think this through. One of the girls who I lied to, seduced and abandoned is trying to ruin my life. Shouldn't be too hard to figure out which one it is. Oh, dear God!"," Yes!  Some woman that I slept with and screwed over is trying to ruin my life. God, why is this happening to me?"
Barney," Some woman that I slept with and screwed over is trying to ruin my life. God, why is this happening to me?"," That's all of them. Okay. Stay calm. Let's think this through. One of the girls who I lied to, seduced and abandoned is trying to ruin my life. Shouldn't be too hard to figure out which one it is. Oh, dear God!  It's karma."
Barney," Nah, it's not Karma. She's stripping in Vegas. Plus, we're good."," It's karma.  Look, if you want to figure out who it is, why don't you just start by checking your list?"
Barney," My list? Dude, do not pretend you're not the kind of guy who keeps a list of all the girls he's slept with."," Look, if you want to figure out who it is, why don't you just start by checking your list?  I have one. It's called my marriage license."
Barney," Ted, don't be crass. I would never demean the women that I've slept with by putting their names on some tawdry list."," Come on, let's see the list.  This is a scrapbook of all of the women I've slept with. I made it at the Scrapbook Barn on 7th. Ask for Heloise. Tell her I sent you. What do you think, Lil? You recognize the saboteur?"
Barney," This is a scrapbook of all of the women I've slept with. I made it at the Scrapbook Barn on 7th. Ask for Heloise. Tell her I sent you. What do you think, Lil? You recognize the saboteur?"," Ted, don't be crass. I would never demean the women that I've slept with by putting their names on some tawdry list.  I don't know, Barney. I only saw her face."
Barney," All of them, but only about half buy a copy on the way out."," How many of these girls know they're being photographed?  Oh, Barney, you're never gonna figure out which one of these is the mystery woman. All of these women have a right to hate you."
Barney, Absolutely. And what I do with these women should be between me and them. And you guys. And Heloise. She helped me do the decoupage.," Oh, Lily, come on, lighten up. I mean, any girl who's gonna be with a guy like Barney and do this or that, or this and that, or do this with those in that... I mean, she should have known what she was getting into.  I don't know, Barney. I don't recognize any of these women. I mean, some minor celebrities, one government official, and what appears to be a national fast food chain mascot."
Barney, This is impossible. There's too many girls. How the hell am I gonna narrow this down?," I don't know, Barney. I don't recognize any of these women. I mean, some minor celebrities, one government official, and what appears to be a national fast food chain mascot.  The top 64 women I've slept with, split into four regions. This tournament will systematically narrow down which girl has the most cause to hate my guts. Last girl standing has to be the saboteur."
Barney," The top 64 women I've slept with, split into four regions. This tournament will systematically narrow down which girl has the most cause to hate my guts. Last girl standing has to be the saboteur."," This is impossible. There's too many girls. How the hell am I gonna narrow this down?  Absolutely not, Barney. We are not going to make a game out of the women you've tricked into sleeping with you. No way!"
Barney," Okay, okay, everybody! Hands."," Oh, she only bought him a one-way ticket!  12 hours to live!"
Barney," Okay, toss up. Thought I was Jorge Posada, or You have my d*ad wife's kidney?", Damn it!  Kidney!
Barney, That's true..., She bought Yankees season tickets to watch him play!  It's d*ad wife's kidney. How are we even discussing this?
Barney," Down to the sweet 16. And coming out of the Upper West Side, we have the number three seed, Girl who thought I owned Google, up against the number seven seed, Girl who thought I was a scuba instructor.", I was there. Trust me. It's fake baby.  You got to go scuba instructor.
Barney," Yeah, she did.", She got the bends!  Evil twin!
Barney, I'm going with Evil Twin.," Barney, you're the tiebreaker.  You're kidding me!"
Barney," Sorry, but I did sleep with that girl twice. As Barney and Larney. Okay, we're down to the Final Four. What do you think, people? Come on, dig deep.", You're kidding me!  Oh! I can't decide. It could be any one of them.
Barney, Come on! Marshall?, Is that the blackboard from my classroom?  I'm tired and sad.
Barney, Mosby?," I'm tired and sad.  I want to call my mom, just tell her I love her."
Barney," Okay. Then this is as far as we get. The Final Four. It's got to be Meg, Anna, Kate or Holly. We are gonna track these girls down, and you're going to tell me which one approached you at the bar."," I want to call my mom, just tell her I love her.  You guys stole my blackboard!In the street"
Barney," Okay, there's her building. When she comes out, I'm gonna hide, and once you figure out if she's the girl from the bar, we run like hell.", You guys stole my blackboard!In the street  No.
Barney, What do you mean no?," No.  That woman, like every woman in your Final Four, deserves an apology, and I'm not telling you if she's the one until hear you say, I'm sorry."
Barney," Are you nuts? That would involve me speaking to a woman I've already had sex with, which, frankly, is a little t like changing the oil in a rental car."," That woman, like every woman in your Final Four, deserves an apology, and I'm not telling you if she's the one until hear you say, I'm sorry.  Barney, you're doing this."
Barney," Lily, this girl hates me. I hooked up with her in an apartment I was pretending was my own, told her I loved her, and then ditched her there. She got arrested for trespassing, bit a cop, and spent eight days in jail. Oh, crap, there she is! If she sees me, she's gonna k*ll me!"," Barney, you're doing this.  Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Hey, Meg! Over here! Look who it is! Yo old friend Meg: Barney! Barney?"
Barney," If she kills me, I want you to go into my apartment, grab the metal briefcase under my bed and throw it in the East River."," Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Hey, Meg! Over here! Look who it is! Yo old friend Meg: Barney! Barney?  What are you doing here?"
Barney," Look, Meg, we need to talk."," What are you doing here?  It was all my fault. I know it was, baby. I just came on too strong."
Barney, And I forgive you. I love you.," It was all my fault. I know it was, baby. I just came on too strong.  Oh, my God! I love you, too!"
Barney," So you remember who this one is, right?"," No! What's the matter with you? Get off of him! Look, she's not the one, but you still owe her an apol...  Yes. You told her you were Ted and that you were an architect."
Barney," Right, and if you recall, her computer had a web cam and a T-1 line, so I..."," Yes. You told her you were Ted and that you were an architect.  Yeah, I know, Barney, you showed me. And that still doesn't count as a Christmas present. So go over there and apologize."
Barney," Ah, there she is."," Yeah, I know, Barney, you showed me. And that still doesn't count as a Christmas present. So go over there and apologize.  Ooh and she's holding hot coffee. Maybe she'll throw it in your face."
Barney," You're really enjoying this, aren't you?", Ooh and she's holding hot coffee. Maybe she'll throw it in your face.  I'm making a scrapbook.
Barney," Anna, hi."," I'm making a scrapbook.  Look who it is, Mr. Big sh*t Architect. If you're here to ask me to take down the Web site, forget it."
Barney, What Web site?," Look who it is, Mr. Big sh*t Architect. If you're here to ask me to take down the Web site, forget it.  Ted-Mosby-Is-A-Jerk-dot-com."
Barney," You're right, I do deserve that. That's all I came here to say. You know what? I don't care who knows about it. Excuse me. Excuse me. I, Ted Mosby, am a jerk to women. Tell your sisters. Tell your daughters to stay away! Ted-Mosby-Is-A-Jerk-dot-com."," Ted-Mosby-Is-A-Jerk-dot-com.  And that little Web site went on to get 400,000 hits. Thanks, Barney!"
Barney, She's...," Okay, which one is this again?  Larney! Die!"
Barney, Is it her?, Larney! Die!  Die!
Barney, You look good. Have you lost weight?," Smile.  We're down to the number one seed. I knew it was Holly. It had to be Holly. Man, I was hoping it wasn't Holly."
Barney," We're down to the number one seed. I knew it was Holly. It had to be Holly. Man, I was hoping it wasn't Holly."," You look good. Have you lost weight?  Barney, did you hear that? Somebody's stealing my truck. Barney? Barney!"
Barney," But in my defense, she was kind of annoying.", That is the worst thing you've ever done. That's the worst thing anyone has ever done.  She's gonna k*ll you.
Barney, Holly.," Barney.  Mark, come over here. Barney, this is my fianc'. Mark."
Barney," Well then, to the last Fourth of July weekend I'll spend getting eaten alive by mosquitoes."," And if you ditching Holly in the woods made her stop running around with guys like you, then cheers.  Fourth of July? We started dating in June."
Barney," No, the worst part is that we still have no idea who my stalker is."," We ruined their lives. And the worst part of it is that you didn't apologize to any of those women.  Well, that's because you're going about this all wrong. I mean, why chase someone who's following you? All you need to do is go down to the bar, h*t on someone, and wait until she turns up."
Barney, That's not a bad idea.," Well, that's because you're going about this all wrong. I mean, why chase someone who's following you? All you need to do is go down to the bar, h*t on someone, and wait until she turns up.  I'll pretend to be the girl that you're hitting on."
Barney, I'm in.," No. Look, I can do this, okay? I mean, how else are you going to find out who this girl is.  Okay, here's how it's gonna work. Now, Lily..."
Barney," Talking, we should be talking. Words. Here are words. Why is this so hard? Laughter!","...she knows what you look like, so just hang out at the jukebox, and don't draw any attention to yourself. And the guys will be in the booth, just pretending to have a normal conversation.  And then I'll come in, looking hot as all hell."
Barney," Hey, there, how are you doing?"," I just, uh.... Shh, go away. But come back later. And then Barney will make his move.  Fine, Barney. I mean, um, fine, stranger."
Barney," Wow, you really are awful at this, aren't you?"," Fine, Barney. I mean, um, fine, stranger.  Get your hand off my thigh, Barney."
Barney," It's supposed to look like we're about to hook up, Robin."," Get your hand off my thigh, Barney.  You know I'm curious. What do you say to these girls to get them to come home with you?"
Barney," Usually I just lean in and whisper this one thing in their ear. You're a little turned on right now, aren't you?"," You know I'm curious. What do you say to these girls to get them to come home with you?  No. Oh. Look, somebody's watching us. Make your move to the bathroom."
Barney," Uh, I'm going to go to the bathroom now, but, uh, when I come back we'll go to my place and have sex."," No. Oh. Look, somebody's watching us. Make your move to the bathroom.  Dude, dude, dude, look. Blonde girl heading over to Robin right now. We are go."
Barney, I don't recognize her. She's not on the Top 64., I don't know what to do with my hands. What do I normally do with my hands?(Barney joins them at the booth)Barney. I brought a copy of the bracket. Which one is she?  Not even on bracket. Cinderella story comes out of nowhere to win the whole thing. That'll warm your heart.
Barney," I don't even recognize her. I don't remember you. I've spent the last two days trying to remember every girl that I've slept with and all the horrible things that I have done to them. And I have done some horrible things. I mean, at one point, I'm pretty sure I sold a woman. I didn't speak the language, but I shook a guy's hand, he gave me the keys to a Mercedes, and I left her there. I'm the guy who keeps a scrapbook of all of the women I have slept with, but I never thought I was the guy who would sleep with a girl and not even remember her. So from the bottom of my heart, for whatever I did to you, I apologize."," Are you okay?  Oh, Barney! Oh, I'm so proud of you. That's not her. I'm so sorry."
Barney, What? What?," Oh, Barney! Oh, I'm so proud of you. That's not her. I'm so sorry.  Barney, I'm sorry, that's my friend Sally from work. We just ran into each other."
Barney, So I apologized for nothing?," Barney, I'm sorry, that's my friend Sally from work. We just ran into each other.  Yes, but it was a great apology. And a perfect way to end my scrapbook. I'm going to call this photo Barney's Redemption. Could you stop giving me the finger?"
Barney," Ted, this is new york city... You're never gonna drive it. This is a really, really stupid purchase, and I'm sorry, but none of us can support it. g*n for eternity!", A new car!  You can't call g*n for eternity.
Barney, I just called it.," You can't call g*n for eternity.  You can't just call things, barney."
Barney, I call that I can call things!," You can't just call things, barney.  Hey, baby."
Barney," What, that's it? You're upset because a guy talked loudly near you?"," Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.  Barney, I have never been screamed at like that in my life."
Barney," I got screamed at three times today. Once in Korean. This is corporate America, Marshall. Screaming is a motivational tool, like christmas bonuses or sexual harassment. It's just good business."," Come on, when's the last time you got screamed at at work?  Oh, baby, it's just not fair. You've been working so hard. Late nights, weekends. I never see you. We've barely made love in weeks. It's bad, guys, mama needs her sugar."
Barney," Just because you weren't around for this, I called g*n for all eternity in Ted's car.", I begged my body not to do it. But it was no use. I just... I just...  Dude I can't believe you cried in front of your boss.
Barney, Dude I can't believe you cried in front of your boss.," Just because you weren't around for this, I called g*n for all eternity in Ted's car.  I don't know what happened. There's just something about being yelled at like that, like I was being scolded by my dad. Suddenly... suddenly I was a little boy."
Barney, Ooh. ooh. ninjas are cool.," And the worst thing is, tomorrow morning I have to walk into Arthur's office and give him the ninja report.  How the hell am I supposed to face this guy again?"
Barney," Gary blauman did it. Guy I used to work with, the guy's a legend now. We were at the morning meeting and old Blauman was getting reamed out but good."," It's great to fantasize about, but nobody ever actually does it.  Pretty much routine at the morning meeting, but then, on this particular day, something amazing happened."
Barney," Pretty much routine at the morning meeting, but then, on this particular day, something amazing happened."," Gary blauman did it. Guy I used to work with, the guy's a legend now. We were at the morning meeting and old Blauman was getting reamed out but good.  You made yourself look bad, you made this company look bad, and quite frankly, you made our friends, the North Koreans, look bad! And I'll tell you something else, Blauman, if you think for one moment..."
Barney," Oh, snap."," You know what, Bilson? You can kiss my ass.  What?"
Barney, Does this help?," Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Uh, look, could you guys just look away for a second till I get started? Come on. Come on.  Eventually, he just gave up and left. And then his cousin's website t*nk. And then he became a janitor at an old folks' home and moved into a one-room apartment above a bowling alley."
Barney," Eventually, he just gave up and left. And then his cousin's website t*nk. And then he became a janitor at an old folks' home and moved into a one-room apartment above a bowling alley.", Does this help?  That's it? that's the end of the story?
Barney," No, no, of course not... he died."," That's it? that's the end of the story?  How does that help me? How does any of this help me? Can somebody, for god's sakes, please give me one piece of useful advice?"
Barney," Lily, control your woman. The lesson of Blauman is that when your boss screams at you, you never scream back. That's why there's a little thing in corporate America I like to call the chain of screaming."," How does that help me? How does any of this help me? Can somebody, for god's sakes, please give me one piece of useful advice?  Chain of screaming?"
Barney," Yes. The chain of screaming starts at the top. Arthur's boss's boss screams at Arthur's boss. Arthur's boss screams at Arthur. Arthur screams at you. You go home and scream at Lily. Lily screams at one of the kids in her kindergarten class. Then that kid screams at her dad, Arthur's boss's boss. And the whole thing starts all over again, Thus completing the circle of screaming.", Chain of screaming?  I thought it was a chain of screaming.
Barney," It's a circle, Ted, I called it a circle.", I thought it was a chain of screaming.  I don't scream at Lily.
Barney," Fine! You want it to be a chain of screaming, it's a chain of screaming. I came up with the circle idea halfway through, 'cause I thought it was a more elegant metaphor, but fine, ruin it! You guys always undermine me when I'm trying to make a point, and I'm sick of it! God, I'm surrounded by idiots! Idiots! See, doesn't everyone feel better now?"," So it's not a circle.  Lily, I need your take on this. What... what should I do?"
Barney," Oh, God."," Well, what I teach my kids in kindergarten... ...When dealing with a bully, the most important thing is to be constructive and positive.[LILY'S SCENARIO]"
Barney," Hey, marshall."," After we all finished talking last night, I went to the diner to finish working on the ninja report.  How long have you been sitting there?"
Barney," If you go in there with Lily's kindergarten nonsense, you're gonna get torn apart. I'm here to save your life. you hungry?"," How long have you been sitting there?  Yeah, I was just about to order."
Barney, What do you want?," Yeah, I was just about to order.  A sandwich and gravy fries."
Barney," A green tea with lemon for me, and for my friend here, the meatloaf, please."," Okay, friends, what do you like?  Very good."
Barney," Marshall, the chain of screaming is a real thing. Arthur screamed at you... now you have to scream at someone else."," No, I didn't want meatloaf.  No, I don't."
Barney," Yes, you do, or else that anger is gonna eat you alive."," No, I don't.  Who would I even scream at?"
Barney, I don't know. How about somebody who's disappointed you? Someone who's let you down. Someone who's gonna bring you meatloaf when you explicitly ordered a sandwich and gravy fries., Who would I even scream at?  No.
Barney," Yes, you are. That waiter is every boss and every bully who ever embarrassed or belittled you. And how dare he deny you the one thing that you want, that would make you happy at this moment. A sandwich and gravy fries."," I'm not gonna scream at the waiter, barney.  One green tea with lemon, one meatloaf. Enjoy, my friends."
Barney, Marshall.," One green tea with lemon, one meatloaf. Enjoy, my friends.  Excuse me?"
Barney," Hey, what are you guys doing out here?"," No, no, I am not going to stand here and take this! I am at the end of a triple shift... that's' hours!... And then I have to take two trains and a bus to astoria to have my wife scream at me because I'm never home. No, no, you eat your damn meatloaf!  Oh sweet, can I get a toot?"
Barney," Oh, Ted, relax, it's Cuban. People pay to have their car smell like this."," Uh-uh. against car rules, it's against car rules!  Well, that's just not true."
Barney," Oh, Marshall, switch seats with me. I called g*n for all eternity."," Well, that's just not true. You can't call g*n for eternity."
Barney," Well, that's funny, cause I did!",You can't call g*n for eternity. It's case by case.
Barney," A 20% tip, really, for that waiter?"," Guys, I'm telling a life-altering story here!  I don't know, Barney, he worked a triple, it just..."
Barney," I can't believe it! If you're not gonna yell at the waiter, Yell at me."," I don't know, Barney, he worked a triple, it just...  What?"
Barney, Yell at me.," What?  I'm not gonna yell at you, Barney."
Barney," What, you think you're gonna upset me? Please, give me your best sh*t."," I'm not gonna yell at you, Barney.  Okay, fine... what, you want me to yell at you?"
Barney, Yeah.," Okay, fine... what, you want me to yell at you?  This is me yelling at you, Barney."
Barney," I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you over the sound of a butterfly landing on a leaf about three blocks away."," This is me yelling at you, Barney.  This is me yelling at you, Barney!"
Barney," Okay, you got some volume, now give me some content. Make it hurt."," This is me yelling at you, Barney!  You don't look as good in suits as you think you do!"
Barney," No, something that's true-- come on. The man made you cry. Make me cry.", You don't look as good in suits as you think you do!  Your mom's a slut!
Barney, Yes.," Your mom's a slut!  Your mom's a slut, and I'm sorry, Barney, but you and your brother clearly have different fathers, And you know why? It's probably because your mom is a slutty slut!"
Barney, Keep going.," Your mom's a slut, and I'm sorry, Barney, but you and your brother clearly have different fathers, And you know why? It's probably because your mom is a slutty slut!  I don't care what you say. Bob Barker is not your father!"
Barney," Okay, now, well, that's just not cool."," I don't care what you say. Bob Barker is not your father!  Oh my god, Barney, I'm so sorry..."
Barney," No, I'm kidding... keep going."," Oh my god, Barney, I'm so sorry...  Bob Barker's not your father! You've concocted this delusional idea that a game show host is your real father, and he's not! You were abandoned, Barney! You were abandoned, and you never dealt with it, and so now you never allow yourself to feel anything, and that's how you survive in this corporate world, and if I keep heading down this path, I'm gonna turn into you! And I don't want that! I don't want any of this! This is not why I became a lawyer. This is not the person that I wanted to be..."
Barney," Don't blame this on me, Marshall. I told you to yell at someone beneath you. The circle of screaming is... The chain of scr... Pyramid... the pyramid of screaming! The pyramid of screaming."," I'm sorry.  How am I supposed to tell lily? She supported me through three years of law school, and now is the time when I'm supposed to pay her back. Now we're gonna lose the apartment. The place where we were gonna raise our children. How am I supposed to tell the person who I love more than anything in this world that I've just thrown away our future?"
Barney," Ted, screaming never solves anything."," Everybody out, everybody out of the new car! Out of the new car!  And so marshall finally had to tell lily what happened."
Barney, Ooh! Somebody you went to Degrassi with?," And old friend from Canada is in town and I'm meeting him for a drink.  No. Actually, he was my first boyfriend."
Barney," Tell me more. Tell me more. Like, did he have a car?"," Simon. I thought he was the coolest guy ever. He smelled like Drakkar. He could ollie on a skateboard. He had the most amazing collection of Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts. We spent the whole summer madly in love.  So he's the guy who... How shall I say this like a gentleman? Robin, did he take your maple leaf?"
Barney," Sounds to me like he gave you your first O, Canada! face."," No, it wasn't like that.  This went on for a really long time. Some of them jokes were elegant and well-crafted..."
Barney, Did you ride his Zamboni?,"...and others were obvious, but needed to be said...  Wait, wait, wait. Did he...? I think I'm out."
Barney, Wha...? I thought you said you were together all summer.," Well, I'm sorry, guys. It was all very tame. We only dated for a week and a half.  Yeah. Summer in Canada is pretty much the last week of July. Anyway, one night, his band just finish playing this gig..."
Barney, You're starting out with two big ones right there.," Well, since you brought it up, let's add up the points.  Thank you. Okay. So, Simon still lives with his mom."
Barney," I'm sorry, Simon. Here we are nattering on about our big celebrity. What do you do for a living?"," No. It's stupid. It's not cool, like Simon's shirt.  Oh, I work at the Splish Splash Ottawa Water Slide Park."
Barney, Which brings us to the most important piece of information from tonight.," I know. I'm sorry. But you guys just don't understand. The fact that he kept the band going...that's impressive! I mean, I gave up my musical dream.  So, Simon, how did you guys meet?"
Barney," So, Simon, how did you guys meet?"," Which brings us to the most important piece of information from tonight.  Oh, I was in her video."
Barney," I'm sorry. I've seen Let's Go to the Mall about a thousand times, and you, sir, are not in it."," Well, once you win Mr. Teen Winnipeg, everybody wants a piece of the moneymaker.  No, I was in the other one."
Barney, There's another video?!," No, I was in the other one.  Robin, seriously, just make this easier on yourself and give us the tape."
Barney," Robin, seriously, just make this easier on yourself and give us the tape.", There's another video?!  No.
Barney," All right! You leave me no choice. From this moment on, I will spend every waking minute ching down this tape. I will not sleep. I will not eat. My life will be a living hell of search engines and overseas phone calls, chasing down something that possibly can't be found.", No.  Okay.
Barney, Michelle? She sounds hot.," You know who gets really bad revertigo?(whispers)Lily when she around her high school friend, Michelle.  You don't know about Lily and Michelle?"
Barney, No. What about Lily and Michelle?," You don't know about Lily and Michelle?  Oh, my friend, you are in for a treat. Hey, Lil?"
Barney, What...(stammers) Do they make out?," Oh, yeah. I'll give her a call, see if she wants to hang out.  Better."
Barney, Finish him!, The coup de grace.  I'd love to!
Barney," I want her around all the time. I'd even consider not trying to sleep with her if that's what it takes. Guys, I've decided to seduce Michelle.", For reals.  Yeah!
Barney, All right. I can't find your video. I've wasted three days tr... What's the matter?," One by one, we all had to go home. Soon, it was just Robin.  Uh... Simon dumped me in his van after the show."
Barney," Yeah, Robin, that was, like, ten years ago."," Uh... Simon dumped me in his van after the show.  No, tonight."
Barney," Ooh. Really?(Robin starts crying)Oh! Oh, come here."," No, tonight.  It's just... when I was young, I was so... vulnerable and-and open to things, you know? And... I guess I just... I wanted to feel that way again. I wanted to be 16 again."
Barney," Robin, that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard come out of your mouth. You want to be 16 again? I have watched your first Robin Sparkles video 1,000 times, and it's not because I'm proud of you as a friend. It's because you were totally, totally lame back then. But now, come on. Pa-cow! You're the most awesome person I have ever known. Well, second most awesome."," It's just... when I was young, I was so... vulnerable and-and open to things, you know? And... I guess I just... I wanted to feel that way again. I wanted to be 16 again.  Right. Of course, the-the first being you."
Barney, No. No. The first is this guy who lives in a place called the mirror. What up?! I'm saying that you are way more awesome than Simon ever will be.," Right. Of course, the-the first being you.  Barney, do you want to come back to my place?"
Barney, Your place?," Barney, do you want to come back to my place?  Are you sure you want to do this?"
Barney, Are you sure you want to do this?," Your place?  Yeah. I am. Let's just not tell anyone about this, okay?"
Barney," Of course. So, should I just put it in?"," Yeah. I am. Let's just not tell anyone about this, okay?  Yeah, why not?"
Barney, Is that Tiffany? Mm-hmm. You are so rad. It's everything I want it to be and more.," This was my big artistic follow-up toLet's Go to the Mall. It kind of t*nk.  Oh, I'm so glad."
Barney, Is that Alan Thicke?," Oh, I'm so glad.  Yeah."
Barney," You know, if you reedit it, there's a tampon commercial in here somewhere. Do you seem how lame you were back then?"," Yeah.  Yeah, you're right. I was lame."
Barney," Totally lame. Ugh. And, of course, the robot makes an appearance in the sad love ballad."," Yeah, you're right. I was lame.  He was my sidekick. He had to be."
Barney, Are you saying you don't wanna be bros anymore?," Now kids, the spring of 2008 was a complicated time in your old man's life. (Cut to when Ted and Barney was in the limo) The last time I had seen Barney was shortly after I found out he has spent the night with Robin.  I'm saying I don't wanna be friends anymore."
Barney," Ted, I'm sorry, I haven't returned your calls."," It's Barney. (To Barney, in the phone) Dude, seriously you need to stop calling me.  (in the phone) Yeah I never called you, you called me fifteen times and my parents twice."
Barney," I'm sorry, I gotta let you go. It's just too many good wingmen out there. Ted are you crying?"," (in the phone) Yeah I never called you, you called me fifteen times and my parents twice.  No I'm not."
Barney," Sh! Let it out, let it out.", No I'm not.  Goodbye Barney. (He hangs up)
Barney," No offence Randy, but there is a long list of candidats for this slot. This slot is for vice president of awesome. And you are like assistant under secretary of only ok."," Hey Barney, new sky mall come in. So worldaround blog's fear is you are looking for a new wingman. I wanna let you know, I'm available. Just the say the word, or don't even say the word. Just do something with you eyebrow. Was that it?  Assistant under secretary of only ok. Thank you, I will not let you down."
Barney," (in the phone) Pitt, Barney Stinson!"," So uncle Barney began to search for a new wingman.  Hey! I haven't been calling you, it has been a while."
Barney," Yeah. Yeah. So, listen you should meet me in McLaren's tonight."," Hey! I haven't been calling you, it has been a while.  You never gonna believe this. I'm at the hospital. Just had a baby daughter."
Barney, So what do you think? 9:30 or 10 o'clock? (They both hang up)," You never gonna believe this. I'm at the hospital. Just had a baby daughter.  Starry Porten, Barney Stinson."
Barney," Starry Porten, Barney Stinson."," So what do you think? 9:30 or 10 o'clock? (They both hang up)  What up, chef?"
Barney," I need a new bro, what do you say?"," What up, chef?  Dude, I'do love to but now I'm bro with Duck Stan."
Barney," Oh, I understand. Duck Stan is a good bro. I'm happy for you. Best of luck. (He hangs up)"," Dude, I'do love to but now I'm bro with Duck Stan.  Crazy Willie! Barney Stinson."
Barney, Crazy Willie! Barney Stinson.," Oh, I understand. Duck Stan is a good bro. I'm happy for you. Best of luck. (He hangs up)  What up B dog, long time no bro, so are we gonna tire it up tonight or what?"
Barney, Yes finally!," What up B dog, long time no bro, so are we gonna tire it up tonight or what?  Here is what on the rocket tocket. My wife is gonna put the cheese out at seven, scrabble at 8:00 PM, 9 PM we watch 27 dresses, everybody's home by 11:00. Booya! (Barney hangs up and he remakes a phone call to Willie)"
Barney, Hanging up on you once wasn't enough. (And then Barney hangs up)," Hello?  So I lanced this thing on this guy's back, and I'll be honest with you, I didn't even know what it was, and then it exploded like a volcano. Plus everywhere."
Barney," Hey, Randy. Could you come here for a minute? (Randy releases a box. And comes in Barney's office by running) Good news. I'm calling you up to the majors. Starting tomorrow night, how would you like to be my new wingman?"," No. (And hangs up)[Barney's Office - Barney](He sees Randy in the lane)  Uh... Just need to check my calendar. Be right back. (Then he goes in the lane, and dances. He comes back.) Tomorrow works."
Barney, Hey., It happens. I knew a guy in med school... we used to joke that we was one ball away from getting walked. (They laugh)  What up bro-seph Lieberman?
Barney," No, uh-uh. Randy, we never use the word bro in the name of a failed Democratic vice presidential candidate.", What up bro-seph Lieberman?  (He takes out his memo pad) Goodbye Geraldine Ferrar-bro.
Barney," You know what? I'm excited about this, Randy. You will be my next masterpiece. It's like with Ted. When I first met him, he was an even bigger loser than you.", (He takes out his memo pad) Goodbye Geraldine Ferrar-bro.  What a loser.
Barney," But tonight, I'm going to make you the greatest wingman in the history of wingmen."," What a loser.  Oh, it's gonna be easier than you think, bro. Yeah. I've been reading your blog for years. You are like a God to me. That's why tonight is going to be legendary... wait for it... dary."
Barney," Oh, okay, Randy, let's do this. (Barney wants to pick up two young woman)"," Oh, it's gonna be easier than you think, bro. Yeah. I've been reading your blog for years. You are like a God to me. That's why tonight is going to be legendary... wait for it... dary.  Ok."
Barney, You ready?," Ok.  Yes. (Barney starts walking and Randy holds Barney by the arm) No, no, no, no, no, no!"
Barney, What? What's the matter?," Yes. (Barney starts walking and Randy holds Barney by the arm) No, no, no, no, no, no!  Nothing, let's do this. (Barney starts walking and Randy holds Barney by the arm) No, no, no, no, no, please, please, please! Just wait, just wait, just wait, just wait!"
Barney, Randy what are you doing?," Nothing, let's do this. (Barney starts walking and Randy holds Barney by the arm) No, no, no, no, no, please, please, please! Just wait, just wait, just wait, just wait!  Dripping with game, that's what i'm doing. Okay let's go. No. Yes. No! Randy listen to me: you can do this okay? Ok. I don't know. Are thos girls really that hot? Yes, they're hot. Let's do this. Okay!"
Barney," (Finally Randy is ready, so Barney goes talking to the girls) Hey, laddies. Have you met... (He points the finger towards Randy and turns around. But Randy hid under a table.)"," Dripping with game, that's what i'm doing. Okay let's go. No. Yes. No! Randy listen to me: you can do this okay? Ok. I don't know. Are thos girls really that hot? Yes, they're hot. Let's do this. Okay!  Hey."
Barney, 13 years??!!," Look, I realize it's weird, okay? Not many people go five years without having sex.  I peaked really young."
Barney," So I threw the pressure air oxygen into its mouth. I sh**t the t*nk, boo, nomore shark. Mr. Hall and I swam back to shore. Hey,let me serve you a drink."," Kids, in the spring of 2008 something kind of strange have been happening to your uncle Barney. He's been doing great with a woman.  He's only been gone a few moments but when he return..."
Barney, So where were we?, He's only been gone a few moments but when he return... ...he gets slap! It kept happening...
Barney, Again? Really? Wait..., Until finally Lily was approached by a mysterious woman who wants her stay away from Barney...so when it happened once more...  Barney knew who to look for...
Barney," Hey, excuse me. Did I sleep with you and then totally screw you over?", Barney knew who to look for...  No.
Barney, What are you doing on Friday?, No.  Stop! Amy?
Barney, Stop! Amy?, What are you doing on Friday?  Abby.
Barney, Riiiggghhhttt!!!," Abby.  Kids, sometimes you can do something right a thousand times in a row..."
Barney, Why are you trying to ruin my life?," Hmm, but, girlfriend, you cannot pull off a tall kitchen.  Well, you slept with me and then you never called me again."
Barney, And?," Well, you slept with me and then you never called me again.  That's it."
Barney," That's it? As far as I'm concerned, if I leave you safe on dry land with adequate transportation home, you've got nothing to complain about."," That's it.  Well, it hurt, okay? And then Ted, the love of my life started dating my boss instead of me. Do you know how that feels?"
Barney," Oh, boo-hoo, poor little Ashley."," Well, it hurt, okay? And then Ted, the love of my life started dating my boss instead of me. Do you know how that feels?  Abby!"
Barney," Abby. A few weeks ago, Ted dumped me as his wingman. You had a crush on him for a couple weeks? I was Ted's best friend for seven years.", Abby!  Ted said Marshall was his best friend.
Barney, Seven years!, Ted said Marshall was his best friend.  Sorry.
Barney, Ted. What an idiot. With his stupid meaningful relationship with Stella., Sorry.  I hate Ted.
Barney, I hate Ted more., I hate Ted.  Are you as turned on as I am?
Barney, Probably not quite as much., Are you as turned on as I am?  I'm sorry I yelled out Ted.
Barney, I'm sorry I yelled out Abby., I'm sorry I yelled out Ted.  I am Abby.
Barney," Oh, cool.", I am Abby.  This is insane. Has Lily even worn half this stuff?
Barney, What?," You know what I hate most about Ted?  His stupid hair. His stupid, lame awesome hair. It's so stupid and awesome."
Barney, You know what I hate most about Ted?," His stupid hair. His stupid, lame awesome hair. It's so stupid and awesome.  What?"
Barney," How he's always like, Oh, I want to fall in love and have a relationship. I care about the people I have sex with. He's so lame.", What?  He's so lame and awesome.
Barney, You know what he needs? He needs to see just how horrible he is when he's in a relationship.," He's so lame and awesome.  Yeah, and I need to show Ted that I'm over him. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
Barney, I think so.," Yeah, and I need to show Ted that I'm over him. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?  You're thinking of having sex with Ted?"
Barney," Ted, fancy bumping into you here. Have you guys met my girlfriend Abby?"," That's an amazing idea. I'm going to go call them. I can probably sell two more paintings with time to spare. Oh, wait, Marshall. There was something I had to tell you. What was it? Oh, that's right. Suck it.(Barney and Abby arrives as Lily is leaving)  Uh, yeah."
Barney," Hi, Abby."," Uh, yeah.  Hello, Abby. So, uh, s-so you guys are dating now?"
Barney," That's right. I am done with this whole being awesome thing. Now I'm all about farmers' markets and day hikes in matching khaki cargo shorts. Isn't that right, sweetie?"," Hello, Abby. So, uh, s-so you guys are dating now?  That's right. And girlfriends are lame. Unless they're me. I miss you, Ted."
Barney," Abby and I are in love. Not hot passionate love. Couple love. You know, movie night with my girlfriend, then waiting for her to go to bed so I can steal one pitiful moment of hollow ecstasy by the cold, blue light of my computer monitor."," That's right. And girlfriends are lame. Unless they're me. I miss you, Ted.  We're showing Ted how lame he is."
Barney," You don't have to say it, though."," We're showing Ted how lame he is.  Uh, okay, Barney, you can stop."
Barney," Stop what, Ted? Stop being in love? Next he'll ask us to stop breathing."," Uh, okay, Barney, you can stop.  We can't stop breathing, Ted. Your hair looks amazing."
Barney," Not before I share with you what being in a relationship leads to, Ted. Abby, Pookie Bear... I am so pathetically desperate for you that... aw, heck, I'll just say it. Would you marry me?"," Um, Barney, I, I see what you're doing. Please stop.  Wait, really?"
Barney, I would never joke about true love.," Wait, really?  Yes, I'll marry you."
Barney, Okay.," Yes, I'll marry you.  Thank you, thank you. I have to call my mom."
Barney, That's you.," Thank you, thank you. I have to call my mom.  Uh, yeah, I don't think Abby knows you're kidding."
Barney," Uh, yes, she does."," Uh, yeah, I don't think Abby knows you're kidding.  It finally happened, Mama. I just wish Daddy were alive to walk me down the aisle."
Barney, Totally committed to the bit.," It finally happened, Mama. I just wish Daddy were alive to walk me down the aisle.  Yes, Lily Aldrin. I sold you the painting earlier today."
Barney," Hey, I think I left my tie here. Have you seen it?"," Hi, sweetie.  No, I'm in wedding-planning mode. Stressville. Population: me. Okay, big decision. What do you think the cake should be: Fudgie the Whale or Cookie Puss?"
Barney," Yeah, that was a bit. We were doing a bit."," No, I'm in wedding-planning mode. Stressville. Population: me. Okay, big decision. What do you think the cake should be: Fudgie the Whale or Cookie Puss?  So I'm thinking Labor Day. I was going to say Fourth of July, but I don't want to steal any attention away from America."
Barney," Abby, I've... I've got some bad news. I can't marry you."," So I'm thinking Labor Day. I was going to say Fourth of July, but I don't want to steal any attention away from America.  What?"
Barney, Ted begged me not to. I think he's in love with you., What?  Really?
Barney," Yes, our plan worked better than we ever dreamed. You have to go to him. Here's his home address. But you know what? He works late, so I wouldn't go before 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning."," Really?  Oh, my God, thank you. But now I feel wrong keeping this."
Barney," Oh, yeah, I wouldn't worry about that. That's made of candy. Later."," Oh, my God, thank you. But now I feel wrong keeping this.  Hey, go to lilyandmarshallselltheirstuff.com or charityfolks.com."
Barney, What are you doing?, Lily threw herself into her painting.  Barney was rehabilitating from his bus accident.
Barney," Bogeyman with a teleprompter. That's hilarious! Great joke, Robin, great joke."," Okay, I officially hate my job. I'm not a reporter, I'm just someone who shows up at night and scares people. I'm the bogeyman with a teleprompter.  Barney, no offense to Robin, but that wasn't that funny."
Barney," Are you kidding? That was a great joke. It's smart, funny, beautiful, the whole package. It's everything you're afraid to let yourself want. In a joke. Bogeyman with a teleprompter. Classic."," Barney, no offense to Robin, but that wasn't that funny.  Okay, what is so urgent that you called me and begged me to come over at 7:22 in the morning?"
Barney," I could tell you knew something was up with me, and you're right. But I can't tell you what it is. I should tell you, but I can't! I have to. I never will! I'm going to. Let's just drop it. What's up with you?"," Okay, what is so urgent that you called me and begged me to come over at 7:22 in the morning?  Barney, just say it."
Barney, I think I'm in love with Robin.," Barney, just say it.  Hey, Lily needs some gift ideas for Stella's wedding shower. Does she like to cook?"
Barney, It's not sweet. It's like a disease. I slept with Robin one time and I caught feelings. I caught feelings bad. I used protection and everything.," I don't believe it. I thought you called me over here to uncuff you from your sex swing again, but you're in love? That is so sweet!  Barney, you don't catch feelings, you just have them. And they're good."
Barney," They're terrible! I can't eat, I can't sleep. She's all I think about. I close my eyes, I see Robin. I, I hear a song; it reminds me of Robin."," Barney, you don't catch feelings, you just have them. And they're good.  Morning."
Barney," I sleep with that chick, I'm thinking about Robin."," Morning.  Okay, so I don't know every single detail about Stella. What's really about? Do you not like her or something?"
Barney," I'm sorry, I don't follow you. That's like saying, How can an ant carry 20 times its body weight, but root beer floats are still delicious? Are the two even related? Really?"," You love her? Barney, how can you be in love, and still be sleeping with anything that moves?  Barney, you're going to have to stop screwing around if you want to be Robin's boyfriend."
Barney, Boyfriend? I don't want to be Robin's boyfriend.," Barney, you're going to have to stop screwing around if you want to be Robin's boyfriend.  Well, what do you want, then?"
Barney, I don't know. I just want to be with her. All the time. I want to hear about her day and tell her about mine. I want to hold her hand and smell her hair. But I don't want to be her stupid boyfriend.," Well, what do you want, then?  Barney, what you just described is a relationship between a boyfriend and a girlfriend. And a pretty clingy one at that."
Barney," Look, Lily, are you going to help me out with this or not?"," Barney, what you just described is a relationship between a boyfriend and a girlfriend. And a pretty clingy one at that.  I'm a kindergarten teacher. I see a confused, little kid in the corner trying to eat the lefty scissors, I gotta help the poor, little bastard. But only if you stop sleeping around. Deal?"
Barney, Deal.," I'm a kindergarten teacher. I see a confused, little kid in the corner trying to eat the lefty scissors, I gotta help the poor, little bastard. But only if you stop sleeping around. Deal?  Coming up next, is your local ice cream man actually driving a roving meth lab on wheels? Stay tuned for the full... Scoop. Really?"
Barney, So just call her up?, Robin just needs to see this new see of you.  Just call her up.
Barney," Hi, Robin..(he jabbers something and hang up) She wasn't there. I left a voice mail."," Just call her up.  You left a voice, but it wasn't male. Barney, I don't get it. You've called a million girls a million times."
Barney," Yeah, but those were just booty calls."," You left a voice, but it wasn't male. Barney, I don't get it. You've called a million girls a million times.  On a booty call, you barely even have to talk. Around 9:00 p.m., you say..."
Barney," On a booty call, you barely even have to talk. Around 9:00 p.m., you say..."," Yeah, but those were just booty calls.  Hey, baby, it's Barney. You busy tonight? Sweet. See you in half an hour? Can't wait."
Barney," Hey, baby, it's Barney. You busy tonight? Sweet. See you in half an hour? Can't wait."," On a booty call, you barely even have to talk. Around 9:00 p.m., you say...  But the later it gets, the fewer words you need."
Barney," But the later it gets, the fewer words you need."," Hey, baby, it's Barney. You busy tonight? Sweet. See you in half an hour? Can't wait.  And by 3:00 in the morning..."
Barney, And by 3:00 in the morning...," But the later it gets, the fewer words you need.  Sweet."
Barney, Sweet., And by 3:00 in the morning...  A question mark? You got laid off a question mark?
Barney, It's no worse than your super-obvious code words., A question mark? You got laid off a question mark?  Rhinoceros.
Barney," Ah, ah, it's her, it's Robin. What do I do? No-no-no-no, aah! Robin... Great to hear from you. To what do I owe the pleasure?"," Great. Now we need a new code word.  You called, said..., and hung up. What do you want?"
Barney, Help me!," You called, said..., and hung up. What do you want?  Just ask her something."
Barney, How are you feeling today?, Just ask her something.  Fine.
Barney, At what age did you first get your period?, Something personal.  Did you just ask me about about my period?
Barney," No, I did not."," Did you just ask me about about my period?  Look, Barney, I'm at work right now."
Barney," Robin, I was wondering if... Nothing. Gotta go. Bye. That was just a practical joke. I'm not really in love with Robin. You should've seen the look on your face. There's cameras right there and there and there. What a legendary prank that we're never going to speak of again.", Just ask her out.  Gross.
Barney, Where are the boys? I thought this was a group thing., I do.  I lied. They're not coming and I'm about to leave.
Barney, Why?," I lied. They're not coming and I'm about to leave.  Because... they're not in love with Robin, and neither am I. I mean, she's great and sweet. I'm not going to pretend that I haven't noticed her body, but this is off topic. Good luck."
Barney," Wait, wait, I can't do this. She'll never take me seriously. She thinks I'm some womanizing idiot."," Because... they're not in love with Robin, and neither am I. I mean, she's great and sweet. I'm not going to pretend that I haven't noticed her body, but this is off topic. Good luck.  We both know you're more than that. Show Robin the Barney I met the other day."
Barney," You mean the insecure, touchy-feely she-male who sounded alarmingly close to Ted?", We both know you're more than that. Show Robin the Barney I met the other day.  Ted h*t that for over a year.
Barney, Wish me luck.," Ted h*t that for over a year.  I just thought it'd be fun to watch a movie tonight, and since you've never seen Star Wars, I figured why not? No big deal. It's pretty good."
Barney," So, Robin... tell me about your day, and not just what happened, how you felt about what happened."," I really do, don't I?  What?"
Barney," I'm not looking to problem-solve, I'm just looking to listen.", What?  Why are you acting like this?
Barney, Like what?," Why are you acting like this?  You're being super nice. It's... freaking me out. Be... gross, be inappropriate. Be Barney."
Barney," I'm being Barney, and I think tonight's going to be de... wait for it... lightful. Delightful."," You're being super nice. It's... freaking me out. Be... gross, be inappropriate. Be Barney.  Right. So I went to the chiropractor yesterday. That guy bent me over the table and pounded me for a good hour."
Barney, Is insurance going to cover that? Sometimes they don't.," Right. So I went to the chiropractor yesterday. That guy bent me over the table and pounded me for a good hour.  That's it? Today I was at the dentist. That guy drilled me all day long. He drilled me hard. He filled all of my cavities. Come on, man."
Barney, Your teeth look fantastic.," That's it? Today I was at the dentist. That guy drilled me all day long. He drilled me hard. He filled all of my cavities. Come on, man.  Who are you?"
Barney, Thanks.," What part, what part?  Nothing? Not even a glance? Even I was thinking about rocking a motorboat on those bad boys. What the hell is wrong with you?"
Barney," I don't always want to be that guy. Sometimes I want to be someone you can have an actual conversation with. Now, tell me something about you that I don't know yet. Seriously."," Nothing? Not even a glance? Even I was thinking about rocking a motorboat on those bad boys. What the hell is wrong with you?  There's a job opening at a new cable network that would be perfect for me... completely legit world news, interviews with people who matter... but I decided I'm not going to apply."
Barney, Why not?," There's a job opening at a new cable network that would be perfect for me... completely legit world news, interviews with people who matter... but I decided I'm not going to apply.  Because I'm a joke. I'm just the scary news lady from some stupid local news channel."
Barney, We both know you're more than that. Promise me you'll apply., Because I'm a joke. I'm just the scary news lady from some stupid local news channel.  It's not as easy...
Barney, Promise me you'll apply., It's not as easy...  I promise.
Barney, To taking chances.," I don't believe this. I believe, she knows this is important to me. She's blatantly...(Ted looks at his phone)Stop watching me, jackasses.  To taking chances."
Barney," You know, Robin, there's actually something, I do want to talk to you about.", To taking chances.  Last call.
Barney, Of course it is. One more for the road?," Last call.  Yeah, why not? Hold that thought?"
Barney," So, here's the deal."," Then, Ted's a lucky guy. Bear.  April, have... you met Barney? April just finished her shift, she's looking to blow off some steam."
Barney, Would you excuse us for one sec? What are you doing?," April, have... you met Barney? April just finished her shift, she's looking to blow off some steam.  You were so nice to me tonight, I wanted to return the favor, wingwoman-style. So, as I was saying, Barney is the Yankees' new second-baseman. And Barney, April asked if tomorrow, you could h*t a goal for her during the baseball match. You can't make this stuff up. So, you two kids have fun."
Barney," Yeah, I'm nervous for the other team 'cause when I step up to that plate... I am not a New York Yankee. Any other night, I would probably try to convince you that I am, but I'm not. I'm just some guy who's in love with the girl that just left, and she's never going to feel the same way. So I'm just going to go.", So are you... nervous about the game?  And that was it.
Barney, And that was it.," Yeah, I'm nervous for the other team 'cause when I step up to that plate... I am not a New York Yankee.

Barney," My name, and tell your nephews to bring their mitts. They're going to be in foul ball country. Come on. The Robin stuff was completely true."," When my family gets to Yankee Stadium, are the tickets under your name or mine?  Damn it, Barney. I mean, for the last time, you can't... you can't be in love with Robin and still be sleeping with every bimbo on the planet. You have to choose right now."
Barney, I choose bimbos.," Damn it, Barney. I mean, for the last time, you can't... you can't be in love with Robin and still be sleeping with every bimbo on the planet. You have to choose right now.  What?"
Barney," Bimbos make me happy. Bimbos make me feel alive. Bimbos make me want to pretend to be a better man. This whole thing with Robin was just a fling, but at the end of the day, my heart belongs to bimbos."," What?  This is just a defense mechanism, because you're afraid of getting hurt. You're just confused."
Barney," Oh, I'm not confused. You know who is confused? Bimbos. They're easily confused. It's one of the thousand little things I love about them. I love their vacant, trusting stares, their sluggish, unencumbered minds, their unresolved daddy issues. I love them and they love me. Bimbos have always been there for me, through thick and thin. Mostly thin. B- man don't do thick crust. What up?"," This is just a defense mechanism, because you're afraid of getting hurt. You're just confused.  See you, Barney."
Barney," Goliath National Bank. The world leader in credit and banking. God, I love Goliath National Bank!","When I first moved to New York, it was dingy, disgusting, ugly, flea-ridden, stinky and altogether terrifying, but then, sadly. The whole city started to go uphill. The streets got a little cleaner, the rents got a little higher, and one by one, the crappy old places we loved began to disappear. The Elbow Room, an old punk rock club, became a drugstore. McHale's, a working-class watering hole, became a fast-food place. And Fez, a Moroccan-themed lounge, became a bank. And not just any bank.  Okay, first of all, you look like the last pick in the draft. And, second, why are you so excited about some bank?"
Barney," Our company just bought them out in a ruthless takeover. Took two months. Cost 2,000 jobs. It was brutal. Who wants a T-shirt? (He throws one to Ted.) Hey, Marshall, they're hiring in the legal department. I could get you a job."," Okay, first of all, you look like the last pick in the draft. And, second, why are you so excited about some bank?  Barney, Marshall didn't quit his last soul-sucking corporate job just to go work at a bank. He's gonna be an environmental lawyer."
Barney, Italian., We had sushi last night.  I had Italian for lunch.
Barney, I don't like Chinese., Oh.  Indian?
Barney, I just said I don't like Chinese., Indian?  Indian isn't Chinese.
Barney," Weird meats, funny music, side of rice. Why are we splitting hairs?", Indian isn't Chinese.  Mexican?
Barney, I just said I don't like Chinese., Mexican?  God.
Barney," I love this burger so much, I want to sew my ass shut.", It's like an angel from heaven landed in the kitchen at MacLaren's. Where the chef k*lled it and ran it through the meat grinder.  It's okay.
Barney, Name two places where things get stuffed.," And there it was.  So, I went inside."
Barney, You know what's not a drag? Getting a home equity loan at Goliath National Bank. I'm just saying.," Probably tucked between her legs.  Anyways, we never found the place. Now, eight years have passed, still... No burger."
Barney, Get this. You know who works out at my gym? Regis Philbin.," There was that one time we thought we had a break in the case, remember?  The autographed picture."
Barney," No. No, we don't know where it is."," And if you tell me it's at the Corner Bistro, I'm gonna smack you right in the face!  Listen, Blondie! Don't mess with me! Daddy needs his meat."
Barney," Listen, Blondie! Don't mess with me! Daddy needs his meat."," No. No, we don't know where it is.  I don't know where it is, Regis, I swear!"
Barney," I don't know where it is, Regis, I swear!"," Listen, Blondie! Don't mess with me! Daddy needs his meat.  What about you, Lurch? (To Ted) And what about you, satchel-mouth?(Giving a card to Barney)This is my cell. You find that burger; you call me day or night."

Barney, All right.,"What are you waiting for? Get out and find the burger!  Let's go, all of you!"
Barney," You know what else is a mouthful? All that double-talk other banks give you. At Goliath, customer satisfaction is our most important investment."," Honey, I'm so excited for you. After all these interviews, after all these disappointments, you deserve a triumphant mouth full of meat.  Barney, I hate to break this to you, but working for a bank's kind of lame."
Barney," How lame is free a*t*matic bill pay? How lame is 3.3% APY online savings? Yeah, that's right. Hate to make you look stupid in front of your friends, but you left me no choice.He laughs."," Barney, I hate to break this to you, but working for a bank's kind of lame.  We should probably call Regis."
Barney, Reg...(He takes his phone.)That guy scares me. I think I'll leave him a text., We should probably call Regis.  Heads or Tails - Studio set
Barney, All right., Just shut up and eat.  Oh my god. I'm never brushing my teeth again unless it's with a toothbrush made from this burger.
Barney," I want... to take this burger out to dinner, then maybe a movie, then take it back to my place, put on a little Terence Trent D'arby, and then I would just... fool around a little bit. Nothing serious, just take it slow, you know?", I think I just had my first burg-asm.  This isn't it.

Barney," I'm sorry, this is...?"," Barney, where the hell are you?  Regis. I'm at the place."
Barney," Of course. I'm sorry, I forgot to call you. That's not the place. The real place is on 106th and Manhattan Avenue. We're headed there right now."," Regis. I'm at the place.  What? Uptown?He breaks a mail box.Fine, fine, I'll be there in 20. If you get there first, medium rare."

Barney," Okay, no onions.", Onions?  Stop the cab!
Barney," One of 9,000 convenient locations.", This is it.  It was ri... it was right here. It was... it was right on this very spot.
Barney, What the...," But... food.  This is your fault, you and your stupid bank. You did this."
Barney," It's not my... Stop, okay.She hits his knee. Stop that, Lily."," This is your fault, you and your stupid bank. You did this.  I will never use a Goliath ATM ever again.

Barney, Will you just tell her already?," They suck, suck!  Tell me what? Tell me what?"
Barney," Well, technically not together. You won't have access to my floor."," Goliath National Bank. That's why Barney's been going on and on about how, how great Goliath is. He wanted you to be excited for me since we will to working together.  But you want to be an environmental lawyer."

Barney, This feels so good. I'm worried I'm gonna get this burger pregnant.," Oh, my God. I just want you inside of me.  If he does get that burger pregnant, I have dibs on the delicious burger babies."
Barney, That's outrageous., What? Come on.  That is unbelievable. Wait. This is it!
Barney," Well, I must go to Stella. Tonight is the big night. I tried before, I always failed. This time I will succeed. Tonight... I am a lesbian. Robin, your lipstick."," During the fall of 2008, I had a little problem.  Oh, no! Take pictures, okay?"
Barney," Hi, Ted."," Oh, no! Take pictures, okay?  I lived in New York, but Stella was living across the river in New Jersey..."
Barney, T-Diddy! You've missed that!, Theodore!  Robin has had the job of presenter.
Barney," First, I no longer have my gold medallions. I sold them when they are out of date, 400 years ago.", Why?  Lily?
Barney," Yeah, and I want another drink for this girl, Doris. I know I can ask this aircraft lesbian."," It's pathetic. It's Saturday night. We should get drunk in a bar. I know this sounds depressing, almost tragic, but it is a fact.  No snakes on that plane."
Barney, You can be at 22h.," With the next train, you can be in McClaren's to 23h.  No, I have to change. I'm not feeling in New Jersey."
Barney, No thank you. I play not with aquariums unless they are my two favorite animals: the pilot fish and torturlute. Did you see!, That's great! We have darts. A half ping-pong. An aquarium. Look how it's getting a great night as planned. One could make the bait and watch them fight.  For torturlute? You're right.
Barney, Marshall., For torturlute? You're right.  You deserve better than that.
Barney, Lily., You deserve better than that.  Not good enough.
Barney, Stella., Not good enough.  Sorry.

Barney, Air Hockey. Well done my fat.," It's not so bad. You can put a mini fridge, there, and perhaps an air hockey.  I speak of New Jersey in general, not the basement. She wants me moved? I do not get it. It was discussed there for months."
Barney," Seriously, I thought it was the only one. Too much!(Robin arrives in the basement) You're glowing. Tape the Barnacle.", I understand why they want to live in New Jersey when you can live in Manhattan? I thought my apartment was one of his reasons for marrying me.  Stella has already warned me.
Barney, How so?," It was not my first day. I arrived and there were 20 people. In fact, I have not really got the job. I just had an interview.  I know. He told me that I had had it."
Barney, Naughty.," Thank you.  That sucks, but I can do what? I will not have another job. You would have seen other women in the interview. They were all more experienced, more ethnic. There was a black girl with blue eyes. How can I compete?"

Barney," If you call now, you'll regret it. I slept with me full of women who were then sent to graze and then decamped. And sometimes they take the phone and they call me and do it again. And when we finished, I see that look on their faces, that look that says they hate themselves and they would never have known. But if you could see this look... In fact, you can see that look, there is a video,http://www...", I called Joel.  Come on. I will not call.
Barney, This is the look.Ted and Marshall are at the supermarket.," not Drink Beer! I remember when I bought it. That was before she became pregnant with Lucy. You can go pick on PriceCo?

Barney," Robin, hangs up. Do not do that."," Shirley, this is Robin. I called Joel.  Sorry, I know, OK?"

Barney, There are currently no positions available., I have been vegan for 2 years. I need meat.  I am a teacher of Yoga. All positions are possible. Your room in 20 minutes. No preliminary.
Barney," I will not do, huh?", I am a teacher of Yoga. All positions are possible. Your room in 20 minutes. No preliminary.  No chance.
Barney, Let's go to your room. Far from it. And can be the whistle.," I spend a very bad day. I've stolen scotch at the duty free. It tells you?  I have no room. In fact, I thought I could stay with you."
Barney, No problem. I just need to tidy up a little. Of clothes on the floor and...," I have no room. In fact, I thought I could stay with you.  And a girl naked, tied to your bed."
Barney," The towels in the bathroom, a real mess. So, give me 10 minutes... to restore order..."," And a girl naked, tied to your bed.  In addition, Barney."
Barney, The girl on reception.," OK, let's go. Who's that?  Children, sometimes you think you live a story, but the truth turns out to be quite different. (Robin is on board a boat, Ted is in his room and read a map and Stella is also on board) In those days, I thought it covered only the presence of Robin marriage. (Stella Tony covers his coat) If only I had understood what it was about."
Barney," I watch this young man dancing near the jukebox, and I can not help thinking... Stella may have made the right choice. Ouch!"," I know. That's all I advance. A new chapter in my life begins today, and we'll celebrate. Here, we need two things.We need Kool and the g*ng. It's time the jukebox!  How can he dance here? He should be trying to smash the car with a club of Stella."
Barney," Assumption. He is not pretending to be happy. Ted is really happy. He did not want to marry from the start. Ted had the best train dodge since Stand by Me Well, not the first kid, but others."," How can he dance here? He should be trying to smash the car with a club of Stella.  No, it is a mess."
Barney," Hey, kid."," I'm fine.  Barney, I'm fine! It is not necessary, and it is rather unhealthy. Sorry, ladies."
Barney, I did not know you'd be here. Girls stairwell.," Barney, I'm fine! It is not necessary, and it is rather unhealthy. Sorry, ladies.  Finally, after two weeks, emotions eventually overflow."
Barney," Guys, let him go. He is happy. Listen, if Ted was married, then he would be married, he would live in New Jersey, and he would be married. It is well. Good, let's eat. Let Flat Michael's?", It's OK.  It is between the 44th and Lex. Impossible.
Barney," Okay, Ted, is there a place in Manhattan where one can dine?", Two blocks from her mother's hairdresser.  Of course. Look at this.
Barney," I will not in this table. Possibly, in this one.", He is serious?  She turns around.
Barney, Where may well be nuts Ted? You should check the garage in the grip of Stella., She looks happy? She talked about me? I do not care.Where are the almonds?  Will the yelling.
Barney," Lily, you're all been there. When we loose one, it's not pretty."," Michael was next to me in Biology. It was a failure for the entire college, but the summer before the third, he grew 30 cm and joined the baseball team. It was becoming a cool guy.Until one day...  You did what?"
Barney, The kids are great.," The Gazeur nickname stuck. He had so much ridicule, he had to change schools.  It made me always feel guilty. But if Gazeur... Michael...came now, as hard as it may be, I would go to Gazeur...Michael... and I should settle things between us."
Barney," I am a person who... Well, are facing. There are a bunch of people I do not want to see... as the group of girls that I skipped... but if one of them came here, I would stay there, and I would look into his eyes. For some, this would be the first time."," Ted, this is ridiculous.  Really, you hide from anybody? Not even... Becca Delucci?"
Barney, Son of a bitch.," Really, you hide from anybody? Not even... Becca Delucci?  Who is Becca Delucci?"
Barney, Do you mind?, Who is Becca Delucci?  Who is Becca Delucci?
Barney, Becca is this girl who lives in the North. I saw her from time to time.," Who is Becca Delucci?  Where exactly in the north, Barney?"
Barney, Bedford Hills Federal Penitentiary.," Where exactly in the north, Barney?  And yes, the visits were of a conjugal nature."
Barney," And yes, the visits were of a conjugal nature.", Bedford Hills Federal Penitentiary.  That's not true?
Barney," Really. And that I had with Becca was a perfect relationship. She was allowed to call me once a week. If it becomes too sticky, the armed guards stoppaient. I've never had to pay for dinner. In fact, this is false. I pay taxes. I guess we all paid for dinner. Thank you, guys. Anyway, at the last visit, I screwed up."," That's not true?  I know it's hard, baby, but I'm in a prison too.Imprisoned in my heart. This room is ready or what? We can...?"
Barney," I know it's hard, baby, but I'm in a prison too.Imprisoned in my heart. This room is ready or what? We can...?"," Really. And that I had with Becca was a perfect relationship. She was allowed to call me once a week. If it becomes too sticky, the armed guards stoppaient. I've never had to pay for dinner. In fact, this is false. I pay taxes. I guess we all paid for dinner. Thank you, guys. Anyway, at the last visit, I screwed up.  You're the only thing that kept me here."
Barney," That's why I'm here, baby. I am your strength. I'm...Oh, my God. Hello, stranger. (He hangs up with the first woman prisoner and will talk to another who has just arrived) Barney Stinson, attorney. Let's talk about your output."," You're the only thing that kept me here.  Hell, no!"
Barney," Now I have letters from Becca who say, I'll come see you the day I get out of here. I'll hang your eyes in my rearview mirror. Women, eh?"," Hell, no!  You see? Are you afraid of Becca. Lily is afraid of Gazeur. (Marshall head out from under the table) are still under the table."
Barney," Boy, this sure is another table. What are we talking?", My father.  From Robin's father.
Barney," Wait a second. Sorry, continues.", My body started to change...  It was increasingly hard for him to act as if I was a boy.
Barney," My poor. Being forced to grow up in Canada with America, right next door."," What do you do? You are teammates, hockey players.Teammates do not kiss! Hockey players do not kiss! Oh, my God. I have no son.  It's sad for your father, Robin, but congratulations for this game."
Barney, The blue line?," And Kyle and I are doing anything serious. It was only the blue line.  You know when you're a kid, you give the terms of hockey at all? The blue line is the kiss, the red is to be naked, and I think that crease speaks for itself. After that, my relationship with my father has cooled. I moved with my mother, let my hair grow, was a Canadian pop star. Young normal stuff."
Barney, It's hot.," Sorry.  And I realized... all my friends were haunted, but there was a difference between my and their ghosts. It was not too late for me."
Barney," There, there.They leave the restaurant and the taxi from Stella."," I'll talk to him. (They go out from under the table, but Stella is gone) She's gone. I'll catch up.  There she is!"
Barney," You can fly it into the lamp? Fasten your seat belts!Not you, Ted."," I will say, Sorry it did not work. We will discuss in adults. She'll tell me his views and... I will listen. What I should have done more before.  You have to get angry. Go ahead. Looking good."
Barney," Come on, Ted. She left you on the altar.", That's his problem.  I understand!
Barney, I have ants in my leg!," Get rid of your demons!  OK, wait. Wait..."
Barney, From cold blood.," It kills!  Okay, tell him that."
Barney," I'm not impressed by the talent here tonight. And more I drink, the less it is attractive. I'm a whiskey and Coke in the Cantina scene in Star Wars."," I'm not impressed by the talent here tonight. And more I drink, the less it is attractive. I'm a whiskey and Coke in the Cantina scene in Star Wars.  And those girls over there? They are cannon."
Barney, Absolutely not.," And those girls over there? They are cannon.  Are you kidding? I have hated as soon as I saw them. So they are cannon. In fact, I've hated almost as much as Robin when I've ever known."
Barney," There is so much to learn. You are only victims of...the effect cheerleaders. Good question. The effect cheerleading is when a group of women air cannon, but only in groups. As with the cheerleaders. They look like cannon, but take them individually? Cod."," Barney, they are canon.  Anything."
Barney, Look at it carefully. Individually., Anything.  I know. The last one is kinda cute.
Barney," And this, my friends, is the effect cheerleaders. Also known as the paradox of a bridesmaid syndrome sorority, and for a brief moment in the 90s, the conspiracy of the Spice Girls.Scary Spice, indeed. (His phone rings) Barney Stinson. OK.Understood. Great, we remember."," Yeah, really cute.  What?"
Barney," Apparently, I'll be a father.", What?  You're gonna be a father? How will it happen?
Barney, It's a girl I plugged in a few weeks ago. It is not certain.She sees the doctor tomorrow., You're gonna be a father? How will it happen?  That may be a false alarm. It is perhaps not pregnant.
Barney," No part of Barney Stinson does not run at less than 110%. If one of my Michael Phelps escaped, he swims for gold. It's a nightmare. I want no children. How can want to have children without being mad?"," That may be a false alarm. It is perhaps not pregnant.  When you're 30 and you're a couple, something weird happens."
Barney," God? It's me, Barney. Are you okay? I know we will not speak often, a bunch of girls said your name on my account. Great. But, God... If you could get out of there, I swear I'll never, never... never, never, never... (His phone rings and people have turned to him) Wait, man. Barney to the device.Really?", Enjoy it. It is a good time.  Good news! I'm not a father!
Barney, Good news! I'm not a father!," God? It's me, Barney. Are you okay? I know we will not speak often, a bunch of girls said your name on my account. Great. But, God... If you could get out of there, I swear I'll never, never... never, never, never... (His phone rings and people have turned to him) Wait, man. Barney to the device.Really?  Congratulations, buddy."
Barney," This is the best time of my life, Marshall. What I feel in having no children? I have never thought something like it as much. That's why I created a public holiday. Now, today is Day of Non-fathers."," Congratulations, buddy.  You create a holiday?"
Barney," Why not? Everyone has one: mothers, fathers, soldiers. Why not a day for singles who like it?", You create a holiday?  It looks like a big day of Valentine's Day.
Barney, Hi. How are the children?," Hello, Stinson.  Ready for tonight, Eriksen? Big merger."
Barney, That's it!, I'm not sorry. I'm just disappointed.  Shut up!
Barney, The No-Fathers Day is a success! Laraby Finklestein and help me celebrate. Matt. Mugs Best Non-Father of the world. There... T-shirts Who is your daddy? Available on fetedesnonperes.com. Looking greeting cards.," I do not appreciate that tone, young lady.Barney and Marshall are in the conference room.  For everything you do for your pear, for all the tape on your desk, on the road darkens your Porsche Carrera, I wish you... a night of threesome. Happy Birthday Non-Fathers."
Barney, Look at the illustration.," For everything you do for your pear, for all the tape on your desk, on the road darkens your Porsche Carrera, I wish you... a night of threesome. Happy Birthday Non-Fathers.  It looks like an Asian hooker."
Barney," Because at the Non-Fathers Day, you have a Thai girl you a blowjob. Tope, puns!"," It looks like an Asian hooker.  It puts you in the mash, then. Your only hope is to be negative."
Barney," My brother, lay your hand on the box tops and repeat after me. Me, the false name you give to women."," Do not depict me as a monster for wanting to remain independent. In there is a lot of people who do not want it.  I, Johnny Banana."
Barney, Swear to always choose the wet t-shirts to wet diapers.," I, Johnny Banana.  Swear to always..."
Barney, Welcome to our fraternity of non-paternity. In is one of ours.," Super.  Gentlemen, Mr. Li, if you will go to page 5 of your file merge. I think..."
Barney," Guys, you did not... This is a picture of me without children. And with macaroni glued to the frame. Guys, I love it.", No one saw the girl drunk?  Lily is not there.
Barney," The last great idea for Fathers Day-No, a pregnancy test, but instead of a blue line, there is a small blue Barney who does that."," Sure.  Day of Non-Fathers, it sucks. It's a feast for the losers."
Barney, What are you talking? This is a good group of friends.," Day of Non-Fathers, it sucks. It's a feast for the losers.  This is the effect cheerleaders."
Barney," No, Ted. It works for girls."," This is the effect cheerleaders.  Look at these guys, individually. These geniuses are not childless by choice, my friend."
Barney, Sock., Good night.  I smell pancakes with chocolate?
Barney," And the cat is in the cradle and the silver spoon Little Boy Blue and the Man on the Moon. When are you going back home, Dad? I do not know when we're together then, son I know we will have a good time.", You're the perfect woman.
Barney, I want to take this moment., You always mycoses?  Which one?
Barney, The last time you and I are just competing for the title of best friend Ted., Which one?  Marshall is my best friend.
Barney, Exactly. Draw. But it's all about to change. Is it correct that you are an architect?," Marshall is my best friend.  My best friend does not, but still."
Barney, You draw what now?," My best friend does not, but still.  Well, you renovate the library Nouillorc."
Barney, I think you'll love what's happened at work.," No, not the New York Public Library. This is the library Nouillorc, in Dakota. Their books are in two parts: fishing and not fishing.  While corruption has destabilized the regime and k*lled most of the royal family, it helped to relax banking regulation in Rangoon. Good for us. Last order of the meeting it was decided to continue on the project's new headquarters in the city of Goliath National Bank."
Barney, That was my first question., Who's going to draw?  Who's going to draw?
Barney, Who's going to draw?, That was my first question.  We approached a company. This Swedish architectural collective called Sven.
Barney, I know. We're Swedish. It's so cool with our baguettes and our Eiffel Tower.," It is not a company. It is a collective.  Sweden, this is not France. You know that?"
Barney," It's France. No matter, I told Bilson..."," Sweden, this is not France. You know that?  Bislon, saving your..."
Barney," Bislon, saving your..."," It's France. No matter, I told Bilson...  No, I get up, and I told Bilson..."
Barney," No, I get up, and I told Bilson..."," Bislon, saving your...  Bislon, saving your..."
Barney," Bislon, saving your..."," No, I get up, and I told Bilson...  Music. Imagine a patriotic music."
Barney, Music. Imagine a patriotic music.," Bislon, saving your...  Bilson, with all due respect... it would be terrible if a job that would suit American architects was relevant to a band of French. Where is our patriotism? Love of country? Our love of all that..."
Barney," Bilson, with all due respect... it would be terrible if a job that would suit American architects was relevant to a band of French. Where is our patriotism? Love of country? Our love of all that..."," Music. Imagine a patriotic music.  Listen, Stinson, no one hates all the other countries of the world than me, but you have arguments?"
Barney, Yes. I know a great American architect who would be perfect. Ted Mosby.," Listen, Stinson, no one hates all the other countries of the world than me, but you have arguments?  All you have to do is come and offer your drawing, I take care of the Board, the project is yours."
Barney," All you have to do is come and offer your drawing, I take care of the Board, the project is yours.", Yes. I know a great American architect who would be perfect. Ted Mosby.  You realize what a hero I'd be if I brought this project to my box?
Barney," It's not the best. We three, we'll work together.", You realize what a hero I'd be if I brought this project to my box?  Ted will come to call.
Barney," Yes, totally.", Ted will come to call.  What is it?
Barney, It works like this: one of us goes into the office the other and said...," What is it?  Marshall, the teleconference begins soon."
Barney," Marshall, the teleconference begins soon."," It works like this: one of us goes into the office the other and said...  Sorry, I gotta go."
Barney, And then you go up on the roof... and drink beer.," Sorry, I gotta go.  It's great. Drinking at work."
Barney," Basically, it is of Mad Men.", It's great. Drinking at work.  Yes! There is too much Mad Men!
Barney, I'll spank a secretary., Yes! There is too much Mad Men!  That's exactly what they would do in this series.
Barney, What series?, That's exactly what they would do in this series.  And then you throw the bodies of cans at pigeons.
Barney, And then you throw the bodies of cans at pigeons., What series?  I do not do that.
Barney, I will realize your dream.," I love to do that.  Seriously, Barney, from what I've lived with Stella, I have this opportunity... it touches me."
Barney," Ted, it's incredible. Detail. Shadows. The liveliness of the lines. This is exactly what Princess Leia would look like, topless."," Okay, be cool with me. This is a first draft.  My way of saying thank you. Okay, you wanna see my designs for the building?"
Barney," No, that's fine."," My way of saying thank you. Okay, you wanna see my designs for the building?  Listen to this. Lily sent me a text message. It was at this bar, The Giddy Ups with full of Woos."
Barney," Lily Aldrin, little secretive. For years, I say that our g*ng needs a Woo, and thou hast hid me in a whole herd.", No thank you... drag ignorant.  You do not need a Woo. Nobody needs it.
Barney," Attention Lily. The world badly needs the Woos. If there were not Woos, there would not Girls Gone Wild, no bachelor party girl, no pool bar in Las Vegas... all the things you hold dear would not exist.", You do not need a Woo. Nobody needs it.  None of this stuff...
Barney," Industry sh**t memories would collapse. Just like the glitter body and that of Hummer limos. The mini cowboy hats would be worn by the little cowboys. And when Brown Eyed Girl happen on a jukebox, you do not hear... that silence. And Brown Eyed Girl. But who would Woo, Lily?Who would woo? Would you? You'd... Woo?", None of this stuff...  Who wants to name my tits?
Barney," Well you'll excuse me, I have a date with Bataille and Fontaine."," Wooo!  The weeks that followed, I immersed myself in work. It was great to be on a project I really wanted to heart.Finally, the morning of the presentation arrived."
Barney, You did not have.," Hey, Barney! Give me the good news.  What?"
Barney, The Board... Sven decided to choose., What?  Wooo!
Barney, I've done everything to change their minds. But they did not budge. I'm sorry., I can not believe I had not. I thought I had h*t the nail. Why did they choose Sven?  It's really bad. After the way the last few months have passed... I guess I'd need more than I thought.
Barney, Finish Your Beer. Fill the machine., I think I need it.  It's been what?
Barney, It's okay. All withdrawals at ATMs are free., Yes. I voted for him.  Teleconference. Now.
Barney, Good grief. I told Heather to put everything back as it was on your desk., You wanna tell me something?  Bilson told me he wanted to give the job to Ted.What has happened?
Barney, Okay.," Bilson told me he wanted to give the job to Ted.What has happened? ... will radiate power and s*ab of the Goliath National Bank. Thank you, gentlemen."
Barney, So?,"... will radiate power and s*ab of the Goliath National Bank. Thank you, gentlemen.  It was great. I like it."
Barney, It looks like we had our man. I not think there need to see...," It was great. I like it.  I'm Sven Jorgensen. With me, there's Pilsen and Sven Sven Johanssen, and it is... Sven! You are the Goliath National Bank. You are at the forefront. You are new and fresh.Women want to be with you, men want to hurt you, but the fool who dares challenge you will be crushed! Your home office will show the world these facts. And one more thing... Do not look now! (It shows a dinosaur) Who is Barney Stinson, the head of the Research Committee?"
Barney," Oh, my God. It's me!"," I'm Sven Jorgensen. With me, there's Pilsen and Sven Sven Johanssen, and it is... Sven! You are the Goliath National Bank. You are at the forefront.

Do not look now! (It shows a dinosaur) Who is Barney Stinson, the head of the Research Committee?  You, Barney Stinson, are a man of power and virility.Your office will be here in the head of Tyrannosaurus."
Barney," I've never known so far, but I've always wanted."," You, Barney Stinson, are a man of power and virility.Your office will be here in the head of Tyrannosaurus.  On your desktop rosewood Honduras, there is this button."
Barney, What does this button?," On your desktop rosewood Honduras, there is this button.  Press! Press for the glory!"
Barney, It's building the coolest of the universe. It could not be more awesome., Press! Press for the glory!  There is a striptease club in the letter N.
Barney, It's not my office. The building was well Ted. That of Sven was better. And I will not let the fact that I am the best friend of Ted influence business.," What is your problem? This is the big break of Ted!You have betrayed to work in the brain of a Tyrannosaurus, which, incidentally, if you knew the dinosaurs is very, very small.  You have not chosen one of Sven because he was better. You wanted an office dinosaur."
Barney," It's a lie! I chose it because it... He breathes f*re, Marshall.", You have not chosen one of Sven because he was better. You wanted an office dinosaur.  f*re Marshall.
Barney, I have not even paid attention., f*re Marshall.  How could you do that to Ted after all that happened with Stella? You are an egoist.
Barney," I never made a career choice by selfishness. I am a professional. Go. Spend a good day, drunk, and throw the bodies of the pigeons."," How could you do that to Ted after all that happened with Stella? You are an egoist.  No. For two reasons. A, pigeons are smarter than you think. They are resentful. And two, it's our last conference call, Mr. Stinson. There are repercussions to ride a friend."
Barney, Like what?," No. For two reasons. A, pigeons are smarter than you think. They are resentful. And two, it's our last conference call, Mr. Stinson. There are repercussions to ride a friend.  Because, that."
Barney," That's great, Sven. You are so much cooler than Marshall. He has not even mix. Who wants a foam?", LL Cool J stuff always comes out?  I do not understand. Where is the call?
Barney," It's the call. Got it? In America, when we work late, you lie on a conference call, and here we ascend a few beers. It's great.", I do not understand. Where is the call?  It's a waste of time. Pumps!
Barney, It turned Sven., What hat?  What?
Barney," Those guys were morons. Of course, they had cool ideas... really cool ideas. In fact, I wonder if it's not too late...The fact is: you have the job.", What?  Really?
Barney," The committee realized he had erred. In addition, you are precious to them and they want you to be happy.", Really?  It's weird.
Barney," Your plans were the best and you deserve it. You should know one thing that you did not get the job early. You see, Ted..."," It's weird.  It was Bilson. Bilson wanted to have a head office in the dinosaur, Barney convinced him that it was really, really stupid."
Barney, You know...," It was Bilson. Bilson wanted to have a head office in the dinosaur, Barney convinced him that it was really, really stupid.  Thank you, Barney. I believe it. I brought in my box the largest contract that she had. Wooo! (Now, only my love life is a disaster!) The next is for me."
Barney, Why you helped me?," Thank you, Barney. I believe it. I brought in my box the largest contract that she had. Wooo! (Now, only my love life is a disaster!) The next is for me.  You did the right thing. You got a well deserved boost. And then it would have disappointed Ted, and it is finally... very happy for the moment."
Barney," You are truly the best friend Ted. And me too. Tie.Thank you, Marshall."," You did the right thing. You got a well deserved boost. And then it would have disappointed Ted, and it is finally... very happy for the moment.  Marshall eventually cracked and confessed the truth about Barney, like, ten minutes later, so much so that Uncle Barney attached to a mechanical bull, set to position Mixed Paint and it returned."
Barney," Me too, buddy."," I love you, man.  You mount the bull?"
Barney," No, even if you pay me. I have an inner ear problem.", You mount the bull?  It was a rather brilliant night.
Barney," That's right, girls."," three hours. This is the record of the bar.  You know what would be really crazy, funny and stupid to do tonight? If you and I, we found a guy to do it for three."
Barney, You can not measure something like that in a while. It is step by step. From his bed at the front door. Bam! You're outside. Next!," Just 10,000 glasses. No matter how long it takes.  But you're beginning to recover when you meet the person who puts you in the game. This is the story of how I met this person. (Ted takes the elevator with a woman. She goes out and Ted is in the elevator) Children, if you go swimming, you immerse them directly. (Another, he finds himself again in the elevator with the woman) First, you dip your toe in the water."
Barney," Seriously. No chance it works on Robin. It will come, take a look at this idiot and send tampers."," Two out of three. He assured me.  She'll b*at him up, yes."
Barney, The naked guy works! It will revolutionize the blows of an evening! It's like the forward pass in American football.Dunk the basketball. This stuff barber where they hold the wick and cut above. It changes everything!," The business returns for Mr. Popol.  Barney, this guy has slept with Robin, you say that being in love. How it makes you excited?"
Barney," The naked guy is more important than me and Robin. All these years, I broke my ass, with my secret identity, my laps and my gadgets. I mean, I'm Batman. But this guy is Superman. He tears his clothes and go."," Barney, this guy has slept with Robin, you say that being in love. How it makes you excited?  What kind of gadgets you talking about?"
Barney," You're welcome. There is also revenge, bounce back, parachuting. When you're traveling, but instead of going to the hotel, you'll live in a bar to find a girl to get a foothold."," I'll give you 50. There's sex reconciliation... breaking sex, and sex a friend told you about a new position.  Oh, that, the kiss for a roof."
Barney," Curiosity, style, Me have always wondered how to do this is with a great girl. Big guy not a girl, just great. Like...if a normal girl was 2.10 m, 2.25 m high, and... wearing a mini denim skirt. I wonder how it is."," The sex hotel room.  Sex, He says he loves you, but do not want to say the same."
Barney, Condoms will expire., 44.  45. It gets a little tough.
Barney, 46!," 45. It gets a little tough.  Still 4. You make a crisp fall on his knees and the when you picked up, he thinks it is an approach, and it happens."
Barney," You mean the naked genius. All this time I wore a suit when I should have removed it. That's it. I The guy naked, tonight. And you too.", The good? Mitch? The guy naked?  What?
Barney, With the girl from the elevator. You're with her tonight?Dude naked!," What?  This is the first girl I had the courage to invite, from Stella."
Barney, Dude naked!," This is the first girl I had the courage to invite, from Stella.  This is the eighth place I try tonight! I cut my hair 3 times! I am out!"
Barney, Dude naked!," It's not the makeup! It is a sun cream with a subtle shade of... It is for men. It's good, I want my eyes stand out.  No, Barney, I like Vicky. It could be serious. I want to do anything stupid to jeopardize that."
Barney," I really like... this girl, but... I had not seen from behind. I really like... this girl. And I am willing to compromise our future for a night of glory. Dude naked!"," No, Barney, I like Vicky. It could be serious. I want to do anything stupid to jeopardize that.  That night we all had something to prove. Robin wanted to defend his honor."
Barney, Thanks for letting me see your aquarium. You save my life.," I had to prove that as scary as it may be out, Stella and I had forgotten I was ready to return. (Barney from the bar with a woman) And Barney had to prove that he too could be The guy naked.  Sure, no problem."
Barney," I just go to the bathroom and I'm off. Ted, I do. I The guy naked!"," Sure, no problem.  Me too!"
Barney, You..., Me too!  I do. I The guy naked!
Barney, It's great! Why did you change your mind?," I do. I The guy naked!  The evening started well, but... not as good as I hoped."
Barney," Great! OK, the important question: What will your pose naked guy?"," When I realized that there was no future in this relationship, I decided to do.  It's a good question. I have not really thought."
Barney, I thought Superman., It's a good question. I have not really thought.  And the Captain Morgan?
Barney," And Oops, I did not have you seen?", And the Captain Morgan?  The Thinker?

Barney, It's funny you mention the project. Because...," Are you kidding? They still come to turn a guy in my box.Bilson, is heavy, it is clear, but without this project, I have more work.  You're super good. Keep it up, man. Your hair, your teeth are beautiful now. You shine like a diamond!"
Barney, What was that?," Thank you. I needed it. Well, I go back to work. I must insert a plank in the dark hallway of Bilson. You have understood me.  I have an idea. The next two months Ted has paid anyway. We could not let it continue and not to tell her? He had a tough year. Let the fun a little."
Barney, You suggest a complicated lie in the long term that implies a lot of discipline. A guy like you will not succeed., I have an idea. The next two months Ted has paid anyway. We could not let it continue and not to tell her? He had a tough year. Let the fun a little.  But if I can.
Barney," Lie to me, there.", But if I can.  I have a spaceship.
Barney, What kind of fuel?, I have a spaceship.  I have no spaceship.
Barney," But no! Defend yourself! If someone asks, diverts it from the original lie with other lies. I show you. I have a pony.Question me.", I have no spaceship.  It is what color?
Barney," When I was Dandelion, her complexion was of a deep hazel, unfortunately, his barn is located near a chemical plant, which contaminated water. Over time, it became a dull gray and the vet can not do anything to help."," It is what color?  My God! It's horrible. Dandelion will make it? Okay...You're strong! Dandelion is not sick, huh?"
Barney, You've been slow., Not at all.  What is a Zamboni with 2 hands?
Barney," Wayne Gretzky, former Hot Wheels, an Eskimo kneeling.", No.  No.
Barney," Of course, you could not see you point and Bilson."," Wait. If they canceled the project a month ago, why did I go every week to see the new working group?  So we... invented the working group. It was enough just to gather a team."
Barney, All right!, Good job.  Louisa. What can we do about it? Do not like you not understand. You feel the same. After all!
Barney," There is no softball team. We just rented a field, a bunch of guys together so they make you a hero.", When you played third base for the softball team GNB.  My lap of honor was bogus?
Barney, Really? And this open mic night at the Comedy Club?," False! Never lie to his friends. I should never have lied.  You're like me, people? Have you ever considered the amount of fish species? And... the name of these fish?Here are a few. Trout. Right? Sturgeon. I think so buddy.Salmon. I'll say it again... Salmon. Who thought it was a good idea? Bar. This guy is what I mean. Halibut. Thank you, good evening. How do I?"
Barney, Fatal... Thursday evening for everyone., Super. Very funny.  Timeout. You do not like fish?
Barney, Nice shirt.," Hello, lying bastards. No lies before I go to work to get fired?  You're the devil."
Barney," This is the P.T.E.'th floor. Basically, Bilson wants a piece like that, two floors above us."," If it's a lie, it's really bad. And I will do what?  Wait, what is a P.T.E.?"
Barney, Room for Transitional Employees.," Wait, what is a P.T.E.?  What does that mean?"
Barney, It's a place where a manager and an employee initiate a transfer of knowledge about an impending career change., What does that mean?  It turns people here.
Barney, It's serious there.," GNB think we need a safe place to meet new.  Reluctantly, I agreed to design a room where people turn. But I was determined to put my key."
Barney, Really?," I love.  Good job, Ted."
Barney, Yes!, You really want to know?  But this info does not leave the table.
Barney, Read it., My God. I am so excited. (Robin passes him a paper) I will read.  Read it.
Barney, One of them is supposed to be famous?, I do not understand any of these words.  Who the hell... The Old King Clancy is?
Barney, You again. You even found a way to spoil it. Why?Why let yourself do we as a country?," My hiccups are gone. Perhaps forever.  Hey, Mister Whisper. You should not be up there to draw your super PTE?"
Barney," They've turned, eh?"," I can not work for large corporations with no heart. In selling me your working group, I was the most inspired work of my career. In fact, you reminded me how my job could be fun when I'm not dealing with Bilson, so... I resigned.  Yes, sir. But I have good benefits and I have made a great decision. I'll start my own box."
Barney, With this economy?," It's exciting.  So, do we want it?"
Barney, What was it with Bilson?," Ultimately, I am grateful.  After he proposed a career change, I made an impromptu presentation with a four-step approach that put him in the knee."
Barney, You've h*t with a chair?," After he proposed a career change, I made an impromptu presentation with a four-step approach that put him in the knee.  Yeah."
Barney, Well done.," Yeah.  That one, I got to the restaurant between Milverton and Wawa."
Barney, You believe not what happened last night laser tag., You believe not what happened last night laser tag.  People freaked out because of a calibrated in suits who bothered their children?
Barney," Yeah, almost.", People freaked out because of a calibrated in suits who bothered their children?  Go! You want that!
Barney, Go! You want that!," Yeah, almost.  My shoulder!"
Barney, Come on.," My shoulder!  Stinson, in my office! Now!"
Barney, Shit.," Stinson, in my office! Now!  Foul Play, three stampedes, and now this! Stinson, you are a ball!"
Barney," I know, I'm not your precious rules, McCracken, but, damn, the results are there!"," Foul Play, three stampedes, and now this! Stinson, you are a ball!  Listen, you're a good player laser tag. Perhaps the best I've seen. But someday, you will hurt someone.Maybe even you."
Barney, You forget what it's there. Your fat ass is stuck here for too long.," Listen, you're a good player laser tag. Perhaps the best I've seen. But someday, you will hurt someone.Maybe even you.  My pleasure. Do not do that. This game is all I have.And I nearly enough tickets for the remote controlled helicopter. Pity."
Barney, My pleasure. Do not do that. This game is all I have.And I nearly enough tickets for the remote controlled helicopter. Pity.," You forget what it's there. Your fat ass is stuck here for too long.  I can not believe I do that. But I'll leave you one last chance.

Barney, You regret it.," I can not believe I do that. But I'll leave you one last chance. But be aware, if you exceed the limits of a toe, you play the duck sh**ting in your mother's so fast it will make you dizzy. Get out!  It's over, Stinson. You are banned for life!"
Barney, What shall I do? I'll tell you that Ted and I will do. We will introduce and apply the PQ everywhere.," I can not believe you're kicked out of laser tag. Are you gonna do?  Barney, you're too old to put toilet paper because you can play laser tag more. And by the way, too old for laser tag."
Barney," Ted, laser tag has no age limit. As the striptease in the West Midlle."," Barney, you're too old to put toilet paper because you can play laser tag more. And by the way, too old for laser tag.  Yeah, whatever. I added laser tag to the list of Murtaugh."
Barney, No list of Murtaugh.," Yeah, whatever. I added laser tag to the list of Murtaugh.  What is the Murtaugh list?"
Barney," There's nothing on this list for which you're too old. In fact, if you did everything on the Murtaugh list, I would call it a nice weekend."," Yeah? No way! Oranges, it's for the winners, and you little shits, you have not yet put one basket! Shame on you, shame on you Miss Aldrin, and worse, necks make me ashamed! Enough! su1c1de, on the line! And make it snappy!Here we go.  Barney, you have more' years. If you did the whole list, you would die. It was not a challenge."
Barney," Challenge accepted. The next 24 hours, I will do everything on the list. And after that, you go to the PQ laser tag with me."," Barney, you have more' years. If you did the whole list, you would die. It was not a challenge.  And if you fail?"
Barney, I'll spend three hours listening to you talk about architecture.," And if you fail?  It works for me. Robin, you do the honors?"
Barney," Come on guys, you do it!", An agreement of honor!  Are you sure you want to do that? You know how it is.
Barney," To pierce the ear. Done. Well, I go to a laundry at my mother. (Barney hand, then returned several hours later) Do you mind if I use your futon?"," There's some pretty hefty on the list. Finally, do you really think Barney is going to get ear pierced?  There is no futon."
Barney," Put it there, guys.", There is no futon.  What's the matter?
Barney, It's on the list. Landing on the futon with a friend rather than going to the hotel., What's the matter?  I'm too old for this stuff.
Barney," What, this? Just a quick foul '. Just a kid like me has to worry about. Then, pushing a medical on the list. (His phone rings) Hold on. Bar here..."," You got anything in your ear? It looks like the inside of a pumpkin after Halloween.  It is not stop! You know, it's funny, I came to teach them... Do not stop running! All this time, it is they who have taught me things.

Barney, Done. (Barney is McClaren's) Drinking sh*ts with strangers. Done.," The next morning, Barney woke up on the futon in the living room.  OK, Barney? You seem to have a bad back."
Barney," No, it's just the raver's hump. I like it. It brings me closer to my glass. A youth! (He can not drink his glass) You should have a straw?"," OK, Barney? You seem to have a bad back.  There's a side admirable in its way to remain young.Who wants to be old?"

Barney," Making an autoresponder message to two annoying.Done. It will probably cost me a few appointments, but it's okay.",... can!  Your ear begins to feel.
Barney, It's good.," Your ear begins to feel.  I hate to refuse, but you told me that the turkey was extremely thin, and see for yourself."
Barney," New bet, then. If you can finish your list before me, we will cover the laser PQ and you pay toilet paper.Biodegradable and not this crap. I want up there forever."," Removes colonoscopy and sleeping with an old, and is a cinch.  Well, if I finished first, it's six hours of study of American architecture from the early 20th, and you can not ever do something in the list of Murtaugh. This is for your own good."
Barney, Bet held.," Well, if I finished first, it's six hours of study of American architecture from the early 20th, and you can not ever do something in the list of Murtaugh. This is for your own good.  An agreement of honor!Back to basketball practice..."
Barney, I just had a little screw up my knee and it hurts incident., Put on reading glasses. Done. Yelled the boy from the neighborhood. With pleasure. (Ted was about to leave when Robin and Barney come but this box) What happened to you?  How did you do?
Barney, It... Helped to move the sixth floor walk against pizza and beer., How did you do?  Or you helped steal the sixth floor. They were in a hurry and left the pictures.
Barney, Ted Calls. I want to go.," Yes, ma'am. What is ironic is that...  Okay. I call it. But it is 4:30 am. It will not be awakened."
Barney, It answers?, Got up at 4am... Done.  I have not called yet.

Barney," No, he remains a. The beer funnel."," As a manager, I threw in the towel. This bet is over.Your ear looks like a Danish pastry in a French breakfast.  It happens. I found these weird Russian beers, in the basement."
Barney," No, no. Okay. You won, I hate it. I hate it. My back is k*lling me. At the rave, I was mistaken for a cop. I have an earache so I can hear... I hear my own ear. Think about it. My clothes... What... Take that! I have redeemed you your best costume for twice its price. This is... $ 30. And throw the shoes. You won, Ted. I will not make anything of the Murtaugh list. I'm too old for this stuff."," Yes, it's... a little hot. I hope this is not a problem.  You know, yesterday I went to bed at 20h because it was on the list and I could not sleep... because it was 20h. So I watched Lethal w*apon."
Barney, And then the hospital.,"... that Murtaugh kept repeating: I'm too old for this stuff, but every time he says, he changes his mind, made another movie, and stuff. What I'm trying to say is that... the toilet, age.Will cover the PQ laser tag.  Good job, guys. At least, there are no points, eh? No idea of the score. It could be 53-0. It could be something else.It's 53-0."
Barney, Really?," My great... you cause me problems since you joined this club. But damn... if this is not the best battle of PQ I've ever seen. You are returned... And right away.  Good God, no!

Barney, Ready? What is the difference between jam and Nutella? (Marshall laughs) It's funny., Tell it.  For the guys.
Barney, Come on. It's funny. This is...," Yeah, I can not hang out with you.  I told you so."
Barney, She'll be back., I told you so.  And we saw more Lily for 4 weeks.
Barney, You know for layoffs?," I've suggested! I removed the felt. I make fun of that? The felt is back.  Yes, I know. I tag. Are you worried?"
Barney," Are you kidding? I know one thing about this company. I will never be fired. It is likely that one day I was stranded on a beach with no footprints or teeth, but I will not f*re."," Yes, I know. I tag. Are you worried?  I would like to have your insurance."
Barney, You just gotta find a way to make you absolutely critical., I would like to have your insurance.  I work harder than anyone in my division.
Barney, Keep your job has nothing to do with being a hard worker. You need something., I work harder than anyone in my division.  What do you mean something?
Barney," You know, something that makes you funny and loved, as Marcus Denisco."," What do you mean something?  Marcus Denisco worked in accounting, and it was probably the worst employee of the box."

Barney," If Ted says that PJ is necessary to society, then PJ will go nowhere."," Okay, but PJ does not help.  You see? It is useful."
Barney," PJ is a guy? PJ, this is not a hottie you f*ck?"," You see? It is useful.  No, I guide him."
Barney," A Guide. I guided a young, once. I made him my co-pilot. Then one day, he hired an assistant to work 3 meters from her room, which... Check it out... is not a hottie, proving he has never listened. You know how to call this type?"," No, I guide him.  Ted Mosby?"
Barney," Maybe. I remember more. Because for me he is d*ad!(He rises) PJ will receive a mail with a disruptive place, it should in any circumstances be three days and then send it to me."," Ted Mosby?  I thought of something to become indispensable.The Ecolo-man! Everyone loves recycling, eh?"

(Hangs up) Wait.Ted Mosby House. The call comes from within! (He opens the bedroom door and discovered Robin in bed with PJ) This is not the Empire State Building. You can not sleep with my assistant. I try to work here, me. How did that happen?"
Barney, Sports-man. I heard people talking about your club.," Mr. Mosby and I are going camping on the roof.  It's a bit harder than I thought. Registration fees, transaction charges penalty, I... keeps a lot of money."
Barney, Last week you were a waste that nobody was looking.Now you're Sports-man.," Really, dude, I know not how long I'll keep.  A waste?"
Barney, Last week!, A waste?  This is Ted Mosby Mosbius Designs. How is the home office?
Barney," I've told you, commits a pretty assistant with whom you can sleep instead of hiring an assistant with whom Robin sleeps. Of course he'll sleep with her. It is the coolest on the planet. I am off topic! You're an idiot! This is my message!You're an idiot! An angry person, that's not enough! Marshall with me!"," This is our apartment. You let a cake on the counter, Mama's going to offer a slice.  Dude, why are you so upset that Ted does not sleep with the people he hires?"
Barney, Because it hurts!," Dude, why are you so upset that Ted does not sleep with the people he hires?  How so?"
Barney, It hurts because I love... when Ted... layer with women. I am a very devoted friend! Lily is the only one I can talk. Tell him to talk to me.," How so?  I'll try, but no warranty.

Barney," You see, Sports-man. People adore you."," You do not use this short-stop that the Mariners have discussed. I must have.  I can be more Sports-man. I'm going crazy! I keep receiving text messages, emails and calls in the middle of the night. Sometimes I even think that I follow."
Barney, You're kidding!," Apparently, Robin and PJ are together again.  How are you?"
Barney," As Lily not speaking to me, I must tell you something.And it's not easy to say, OK? I... wait... 'm... wait... love...wait... of... wait... a... wait... some... wait...", How are you?  I know you're in love with Robin.

Barney," Hire the kid as his assistant. He does all the work and you're still Sports-man. Evil incarnate, Eriksen. Evil incarnate.", I'll find something.  Are you okay?
Barney," Hey, Toy-man!"," Hey, Chow-man!  Who's this guy?"
Barney, He is not here. I think we should leave., Who's this guy?  Really?

Barney," Owl. The girls with a name ending in LY are dirty.Holly, Kelly, Carly, Lily."," I had the number of that girl. Look. Holly.  Yeah, it's true."

Barney, Sorry. Can you repeat that? I do not mean the I-f*ck-ever.," This rule is completely outdated. They know exactly what you do. I have another rule. It's a bit crazy, but I call it, you like him, you call him.  My rule of three days, it is anything. Who invented it?"
Barney, Jesus.," My rule of three days, it is anything. Who invented it?  Barney, do not do that. Not with Jesus."
Barney," Seriously. Jesus began this thing for three days. He waited three days to return to life. It was perfect. If he had waited one day we would not have known he was d*ad! They would have said: Jesus, are you? And Jesus would probably have said, You okay? I died yesterday! And they would say: You have the air alive, man.  And they should explain his resurrection. And the miracle. And then the guy would say, Okay, whatever you want, dude."," Barney, do not do that. Not with Jesus.  The dialogues seem pompous old now."
Barney," And he will not come back on a Saturday. Everyone is busy doing chores. Weave, cut the beard. No. It looked exactly the right number of days... Three."," The dialogues seem pompous old now.  I promise, I'll wait three days. Stop talking."
Barney," And it's Sunday, they are all already in the church.They are all there, No, Jesus died. Then, bam! He burst through the door, crossed the aisle, everyone is excited. And by the way, that's where he invented the tope there! 3 days.We wait three days to call a woman because it is the time that Jesus wants us to wait. True story."," I promise, I'll wait three days. Stop talking.  Okay. I promise. I will call not before three days."
Barney, What?, Bizarre. Holly sent a message to Ted talking about a meal Generro. A second. Band of bastards!  You are Holly! So Ted did not send messages to Holly? He sent to you?
Barney," We knew he would try to call three days before, so I took his cell phone and changed his number from mine."," You are Holly! So Ted did not send messages to Holly? He sent to you?  We wanted to call the chopper too early, but then he... sent text messages."
Barney, Piti texting?," We wanted to call the chopper too early, but then he... sent text messages.  Poor, little Ted. It should... He should say it estnous."
Barney, Yeah. Or... it pretends to Holly and we are in the bath.," Poor, little Ted. It should... He should say it estnous.  It's better. It was funny. He should say that it is us."
Barney, It should. Or... it is said that red is our favorite color and found the look cowboy sexy., It's better. It was funny. He should say that it is us.  It's better.
Barney, He put the boots!, I wear them right now and they are very sexy.  He bluntly put! It was great! But it's time to tell him that he wears.
Barney, Or... we remove our shirts., He bluntly put! It was great! But it's time to tell him that he wears.  It's better.
Barney," Maybe that door below, a black bra with lace.", It's better.  I believe that wearing anything underneath.
Barney, It is hot.," I believe that wearing anything underneath.  There, he wears only cowboy boots! Here we go!"
Barney, Too! Tell him we slowly drag our... What do we do?," There, he wears only cowboy boots! Here we go!  I think we'll... have sex with Ted."
Barney," The crazy eyes, I'm going too fast and I will f*ck up everything."," No, actually it was for his good. It protects it from itself. He really likes this girl. He had that look.  The same he had with you the first time."
Barney, We all know what it gave., The same he had with you the first time.  I'm in love with you.
Barney, And it's coming. It shows all the telltale signs., It's been that Ted did not like someone. He stored much... We thought him to say I love you when he contacted her.  First: he jokes with the marriage.
Barney, You like architecture? We should get married. Ha-ha.MDR. Just kidding. So what?, First: he jokes with the marriage.  Deuzio: it's far too early suggestions crazy travel.
Barney, I like beer. We should go to Germany. MDR. JP.MDR., Deuzio: it's far too early suggestions crazy travel.  Third: it says too early personal things.
Barney, My parents divorced two years there. It was really hard. MDR., Third: it says too early personal things.  And he really knows not what means MDR.
Barney, And then we met Stan.," Yeah, but that's the problem. Ted did not say I love you as easily as we thought.  Why do you so much noise?"
Barney, A guard who works nights., Super Stan. Who is it?  He eats here every day.
Barney, And he had not finished., He eats here every day.  Far from it.
Barney, No matter. It's OK.Ted sits at the apartment to read a text message.," It's... really nice.  And when, finally, we will be together, I want you to enlaces."
Barney," Well, if Ted does not say, I will. I love you."," I do not know... what comes to the bread here, but it touches me... here... and here.  That's cool. Still nothing?"
Barney, How is this possible? It's all there waiting!, It is perhaps not in love with us.  I do not understand men.
Barney, All was well until he sends a text message for Lily and ruins everything.," That guy you fell in love. I hope his girlfriend is not jealous. He spoke of a friend or...?  It's okay. It's over now. I have to leave, but that's what happens: you call it now, tell him what you did and apologize.Got it?"
Barney, Yes. (Barney out of the bar) Or...," It's okay. It's over now. I have to leave, but that's what happens: you call it now, tell him what you did and apologize.Got it?  Holly explained everything to me, it was just a misunderstanding. All is well now."
Barney," That's it, man. This is the I love you."," He replied! I probably should not tell you, finally, we barely knew, but never mind, I say it anyway.  I would like Stan to be there."
Barney, Stan. What?, I would like Stan to be there.  I sometimes have dreams about my gay best friend.
Barney, I sometimes have dreams about my gay best friend.," I sometimes have dreams about my gay best friend.  Ted Why send text messages to a girl he barely knows, where he says he dreams about me gay?"
Barney, Easy. You? He speaks clearly to me.," Ted Why send text messages to a girl he barely knows, where he says he dreams about me gay?  Dude, I'm his best friend."
Barney," Okay, one: It has never been proven. Two: If anyone had any dreams about gays one of us would be on me! Finally, look at me. Now look at you. An octogenarian still in her closet would not be in this state."," Dude, I'm his best friend.  That's the trick. I hug you, no. Who would not want to cuddle in this case, on Sunday morning?

Barney," T'was the night before new year's, and the weather grew mean. It was 3:00 in the morning, And I was stranded in queens. (2008, the whole story of Barney is illustrated with images) The tavern grew empty, the gas lights grew dim. The horse-drawn carriages were all but snowed in..."," Not really.  Wait. If this was last year, why are you acting like it was Oliver Twist?"
Barney," Ted, it's a poem. Last call was approaching, and my fortunes looked bleak. Then I turned to my left and stifled a shriek. She had a peach fuzz beard and weighed 16 stone. She gobbled up hot wings and swallowed the bones. I muffled a scream and threw up in my mouth.I asked, where do you live?And she said, one block south.. I swallowed my pride and six sh*ts of whiskey. And prayed to the gods that she wasn't too frisky. Back in her cave, she prepared us a snack. 'neath her mighty hooves, the floorboards did crack. But when she returned, she found a sound sleeper. And thus she became the sexless innkeeper. And so are you"," Wait. If this was last year, why are you acting like it was Oliver Twist?  Wait, you're saying that girl just used me for a place to crash?"
Barney," Ted, you mentioned that you live right upstairs. She saw the tweed jacket"," Wait, you're saying that girl just used me for a place to crash?  No way."
Barney," I'm not the sexless innkeeper. Ted, that girl had no intention of ever hooking up with you."," No way.  Which is funny, because usually it's the innkeeper who offers turndown service. Oh!"
Barney," Look! I'm sorry that we have been dodging your calls, but we respect you guys too much as friends to give you some song and dance. You deserve the truth. (he sighs) The US Navy has found intelligent alien life at the bottom of the ocean. For reasons I can't explain, Robin and I have been tapped to lead the expedition."," And then on Sunday, we're up at 6:00 a.m. for the fall foliage hike. Now, you better pack your long johns, 'cause it is cold up there.  Wow, Barney. That kind of sounds like the stuff you say to girls when you're too much of a coward to dump them."
Barney," Plus, the alien thing."," Look, all the couple-y stuff, it's just not us. Barney and I are barely equipped to date each other, let alone you guys.  Come on,Marshall."
Barney, I think they bought it.IN. LILY AND MARSHALL'S APARTMENT, You know what? I hope those underwater aliens are cold-blooded. 'cause then you guys will get along just fine.  I can't believe they broke up with us.
Barney," Ted, I could listen to this guilt trip all day, But don't you have to get back up to the inn? I mean, who's working the front desk?"," Guys, Lily and Marshall haven't been to the bar all week. They're taking this really hard.  Seriously, they're your friends. You got to go apologize."
Barney," To your point, Ted, as an innkeeper. Do you do that cheapy thing where you only change the linens upon request? I mean, I mean, I mean, how much water is that actually saving?"," Seriously, they're your friends. You got to go apologize.  Robin, you know I'm right. Ignoring a problem doesn't make it go away. Usually, it just makes it bigger."
Barney," Mint on the pillow, Ted! And don't charge for wi-fi. It seems greedy! It does."," For god's sake!  But eventually, even Barney and Robin had to admit they owed Lily and Marshall an apology."
Barney," But eventually, even Barney and Robin had to admit they owed Lily and Marshall an apology."," Mint on the pillow, Ted! And don't charge for wi-fi. It seems greedy! It does.  Hey. We wanted to say we're sorry."
Barney, Hey. Long time no see. Have a seat.," Hey! Hey, guys.  Oh, we can't. We're here with Py and Shea."
Barney," Hey, maybe all six of us could hang out."," Oh, it's just... We haven't seen you guys all week.  Yeah."
Barney, Who the hell are these people?," Oh, it might be weird. We're kind of on a double date. Wouldn't want you to feel like a fifth and sixth wheel.  They just moved here fromHawaii. Py is a total foodie"
Barney, Pfft. Not us.," Pfft, who needs 'em? "
Barney,, Pfft. Not us.  Hi. Two for dinner.
Barney," Hey, why don't we call that weird couple down the hall from you? You know, with the ferrets? Maybe they want to come over and play taboo."," Just the two of you?  After midnight? No way. We can't tabooty-call them, it's pathetic."
Barney, Maybe. But they're Armani.," Barney, are you wearing sweat pants?  Okay, guys, I've got some bad news for you. So I'm just going to come out and say it. You're a couple. And no matter how hard you try to fight it, couples need other couples. That's why you miss Marshall and Lily. And can't you just admit that?IN. MARSHALL AND LILY'S HOME"
Barney, Ding.," Oh, right back at you!  For charades."
Barney," Then what are you doing, standing out in the rain with us?", You know what? We have two very nice people up in that apartment Who are perfect for us.  Damn it. Why is there something so attractive about a bad boy... And girl?
Barney, We'll never sleep on thegouda again.," Come here, you two.  Hey, Barney. I got a little poem for you. You want to hear it?"
Barney," No, not really."," Hey, Barney. I got a little poem for you. You want to hear it?  'twas the night before, I had hours to k*ll. (the whole story is illustrated with images) I sat in the tavern, grading parchments with quill."
Barney, With quill?," 'twas the night before, I had hours to k*ll. (the whole story is illustrated with images) I sat in the tavern, grading parchments with quill.  Barney. It's a poem. A busty, young lassie flashed me a grin. Her garb said classy, but her eyes whispered sin. She said, you're a teacher? I said, yes, indeed. I must have you, she moaned.I'm turned on by tweed. With haste we did scamper to my chamber anon. We fell to the couch, and, bro, it was on. I unlaced her bodice. Our passions grew deeper. And thus ends the tale of the sexless innkeeper."
Barney, No way. You made that up.," Barney. It's a poem. A busty, young lassie flashed me a grin. Her garb said classy, but her eyes whispered sin. She said, you're a teacher? I said, yes, indeed. I must have you, she moaned.I'm turned on by tweed. With haste we did scamper to my chamber anon. We fell to the couch, and, bro, it was on. I unlaced her bodice. Our passions grew deeper. And thus ends the tale of the sexless innkeeper.  Are you coming back bed, professor?"
Barney, Whew!," Are you coming back bed, professor?  God, I love being single."
Barney," The... mmm. Social experiment.(Chanting)U.S.A, U.S.A, U.S.A, U.S.A..."," You want to go? You want to go?! Come on!(In McLaren's...)Make fun of the Great White North all you want. It's the best country in the world.  Okay, okay. You know what, what does that even prove, okay? You chant anything, people we join in.(Chanting)Canada, Canada, Canada, Cana... Okay, they won't chant anything."
Barney, Shrimp fried rice...," Okay, okay. You know what, what does that even prove, okay? You chant anything, people we join in.(Chanting)Canada, Canada, Canada, Cana... Okay, they won't chant anything.  Shrimp fried rice, shrimp fried rice..."
Barney, What do you mean?," I am ready to h*t the road. I got baby wipes. I got a variety of jerky. I got six cans of Tantrum. Well, four. One b*rned though the can, the other one I drank already.(He tears a pillow)Tantrum! I am so psyched! Marshall and I haven't done something, just the two of us, for so long. Ever since he got married, he's turned from an I to a We.  Think about it."
Barney, Hmm., We no longer have a hemorrhoid problem.  You guys will not believe this. I've been talking to my lawyer all morning. You know that guy I have a slight disagreement with at the Hoser Hut? He's filing as*ault charges.
Barney, Perfect. Problem solved. Welcome aboard.," Well, there's only one possible way to avoid getting deported. My lawyer said I could become an American citizen.  Well, it's not that simple. I'm a Canadian. I was born there. My family's there. It's who I am."
Barney," I know, and it's provided us with a lot of laughs. But, Robin, if you want to live here, work here and throw chairs at people here, you have to do this."," Well, it's not that simple. I'm a Canadian. I was born there. My family's there. It's who I am.  Well, there's a citizenship test tomorrow."
Barney, A cit...," Well, there's a citizenship test tomorrow.  I'll think about it."
Barney," No, no, you have to do it. I'll help you study. We're gonna stay up all night long. I'm gonna drill you, and then we're gonna study. No, seriously. We're gonna do some cramming and then we're gonna study. No, seriously. We're gonna bone up on..."," I'll think about it.  Okay, Barney."
Barney, Sorry. It's a rich area.," Okay, Barney.  It is."
Barney," But you know, it's not going to be easy, this test. It's not like the Canadian citizenship test.", It is.  How do you know the Canadian test is easy?
Barney, It's Canada. Question one: Do you want to be Canadian? Question two: really?," How do you know the Canadian test is easy?  Ted! Ted! Check it out! I got black coffee on the left, I got Tantrum on the right! Do you have a phone book?!"
Barney," I don't know if you caught that, but he did the we thing."," We most certainly did!  Yeah, I heard him."
Barney, Okay.," Yeah, I heard him.  Road trip! So you guys want to talk about bitches? I'm kidding. They're called women."
Barney, How many stars are on the flag?," That reminds me, I have to pee.  50, one for each state."
Barney, What are the first ten amendments to the Constitution called?," 50, one for each state.  The Bill of Rights. Look, Barney, I know all this. I'm ready."
Barney," Ready for the test maybe, but ready to be an American? Not on your sweet life. For you to be an American, we got to get the Canadian out of you. That's why I've created these questions. Question one: Who is this?"," The Bill of Rights. Look, Barney, I know all this. I'm ready.  Queen Elizabeth II."
Barney," No, the answer is Elton John. Question two: What the hell is this?"," Queen Elizabeth II.  Oh, curling. Um, it's a sport played..."
Barney," Wrong. The answer we were looking for was I don't care, it's dumb. Let's go buy something that's bad for us and then sue the people who made it. That's America, Robin."," Oh, curling. Um, it's a sport played... ...because Sparky loved chasing a ball, and it didn't much matter what kind. Tennis ball, baseball, Wiffle ball, golf ball, basketball, beach ball, gum ball, a grapefruit- which isn't actually a ball, but's round like a ball- a football- which isn't round, but it's still technically a ball- Indian rubber ball..."
Barney, Correct., I want to say- Jefferson?  Oh!
Barney, Archie Bunker's neighbor was George Jefferson.," Oh!  Oh, boo-ya! I am nailing this. God, I'm buzzing on America right now!"
Barney," All right, hold your horses. Now to prove that you are as American as apple pie and the childhood obesity it leads to- who is this?"," Oh, boo-ya! I am nailing this. God, I'm buzzing on America right now!  That, Barney, is the American actor, beloved by millions, the Hey, Vern guy from the popular series of Ernest films. And his name... Jeff Foxworthy."
Barney," Jeff Foxworthy? No, it's Jim Varney. You're kidding me. You don't know that?"," That, Barney, is the American actor, beloved by millions, the Hey, Vern guy from the popular series of Ernest films. And his name... Jeff Foxworthy.  Uh, that's Jeff Foxworthy, dumbass. End of story. Now shut your stupid face."
Barney," Not only are you wrong, but you are belligerently sticking to your g*n and insulting me in the process. Robin Scherbatsky- you are an American.In the hotel..."," Uh, that's Jeff Foxworthy, dumbass. End of story. Now shut your stupid face.  Look who's back from the wishing well."
Barney, Good morning.," When Barney finally tracked down your Aunt Robin, it wasn't a pretty sight.  Barney? Oh, my God. What happened last night?"
Barney, You went Canadian.," Barney? Oh, my God. What happened last night?  How Canadian?"
Barney, This Canadian.(He opens the curtains)Oh. That was supposed to be a dramatic view of the Toronto sky- you're in Toronto.," How Canadian?  Oh, God. Okay. It's coming back to me. I, uh, I went into the Hoser Hut... And I met this women's curling team."
Barney," You called me, said you were never coming back. So, I jumped on a plane, flew across the Atlantic..."," How did you find me, anyway?  Canada isn't across the Atlantic."
Barney," You're talking nonsense. Now, listen... You slipped up. It's fine. The test is in a few hours."," Canada isn't across the Atlantic.  Barney, I'm not taking the test."
Barney," God, you're still drunk."," Barney, I'm not taking the test.  Look, I appreciate your help, but... who am I kidding? I'm Canadian. I always will be."
Barney," Now, that's ridiculous. We're gonna get some coffee, in you, we'll sober you up, and get you back to New York for that test. But, before any of that, we're gonna do it on this bed 'cause... hotel room. Okay, let's get some coffee."," Look, I appreciate your help, but... who am I kidding? I'm Canadian. I always will be.  Kind of cross."
Barney, It's like an entire country without a tailor.," I can't believe we're still open. Gotcha! These are getting bigger.  Yeah, give me two coffees."
Barney, What's wrong? Other than the fact that this five dollar bill they gave you is blue.," American money? Didn't watch the Leafs game? No please or thank you for the coffee? You sure don't seem like a Canadian.  Wow. I'm not American, and apparently, I'm not Canadian either."
Barney, And there's kids playing hockey on the back. It's like you want us to make fun of you.," Wow. I'm not American, and apparently, I'm not Canadian either.  I don't want this anymore."
Barney," Look at this money! This one has a moose, this one has a beaver, and they all have Elton John on the back."," Well, you know what? That mushroom's not the only thing that's living. Car keys, please.  When I moved to the States, I swore to myself, I wasn't going to change. And yet, here I am, in the most Canadian place in the universe- Tim Horton's- around the corner from the Hockey Hall of Fame, and I don't belong. It's like I don't have a country."
Barney," Okay, that's it.(He climbs on a chair)Attention, Canada! I am Barney from America. And I'm here to fix your backward-ass country. Number one: get real money. Don't know what board game this came from, but it's a jhoke. Number two- and this is the biggie- Quit letting awesome chicks like Robin Scherbatsky get away because, guess what? You don't want her? I'm planting my flag in her- if you know what I mean, which you probably don't- and getting her the hell out of here. You may now return to being pointless.(He sits down and three men arrive behind him)Ah, this coffee is excellent. Oh. Hey, fellas. It's called a tie."," When I moved to the States, I swore to myself, I wasn't going to change. And yet, here I am, in the most Canadian place in the universe- Tim Horton's- around the corner from the Hockey Hall of Fame, and I don't belong. It's like I don't have a country.  Sparky was my best friend, but after I married Helen, old Spark started to feel a little left out. For so long, it had been just me and him, but now he suddenly felt like Helen had taken his place. What Sparky didn't realize was, even though I loved Helen, I still loved him, too. I had room in my heart for both of them. But maybe I should have put aside some special ball-tossing time just for the two of us t o make sure Sparky knew that he was a good boy. I wish now I had, 'cause old Sparky ran out in front of a Cadillac and got splattered like a watermelon in one of them Gallagher shows."
Barney," Man, those Canadian doctors banded me up, reset my jaw, put my shoulder back in its socket, and they didn't even bill me. Idiots. All right, I guess they're no idiots. The coffee was extraordinary. Huh. I guess Canada's not so bad. They play their cards right, maybe they can even become a state someday."," Okay. Let's listen to it again.  Barney, I've thought about this. When you stood up and told off those people, I thought, Yeah, America's cool."
Barney, Hmm.," Barney, I've thought about this. When you stood up and told off those people, I thought, Yeah, America's cool.  And then when those guys pounded the stuffing out of you, I thought, Yeah, Canada's pretty cool, too. I may have taken a few pokes myself. So, I've decided, dual citizenship. I'm going to be American and Canadian."
Barney," Wait, you can do that?"," And then when those guys pounded the stuffing out of you, I thought, Yeah, Canada's pretty cool, too. I may have taken a few pokes myself. So, I've decided, dual citizenship. I'm going to be American and Canadian.  Yeah, dummy. Instead of being a woman with no country, I'm going to be a woman with two."
Barney, I see.," Yeah, dummy. Instead of being a woman with no country, I'm going to be a woman with two.  You understand?"
Barney," No, I can see out of my left eye again."," You understand?  Hey, baby? Baby?"
Barney, I hate to be the one to tell you. Marshall and Lily get divorced., I decided to go to the bar to be quiet. It was not really that.  Not at all.
Barney, Look what I saw yesterday.," Not at all.  Baby, you can wash it?"
Barney, I gotta go.," No problem.  She makes her dishes right away, Ted. I give them two or three weeks maximum."
Barney," She makes her dishes right away, Ted. I give them two or three weeks maximum.", I gotta go.  There is nothing serious. And certainly nothing serious enough that you hold my hand.
Barney, They have a big problem.," There is nothing serious. And certainly nothing serious enough that you hold my hand.  I see what happens. You, my friend, you suffer from a disease little known... little known because I just invented it... called Adequacy of New Relationship. Robin, you are in your honeymoon stage. Everything is perfect. The songs on the radio talking about you. Other couples are concerned. Enjoy it. The SNR does not last forever."
Barney," If, when you're great like me. Listen to this. Robin taking into account the number of beds in which we did. One is 83 and a half."," I see what happens. You, my friend, you suffer from a disease little known... little known because I just invented it... called Adequacy of New Relationship. Robin, you are in your honeymoon stage. Everything is perfect. The songs on the radio talking about you. Other couples are concerned. Enjoy it. The SNR does not last forever.  And a half?"
Barney, An Ottoman'th in an antique shop., And a half?  What's new?
Barney, Big Tiger. You holding up? Want a hug? You mean yesterday? You're safe here.," What's new?  According to Barney, Lily asking you to do your own dishes right away is a sign that your marriage falls apart."
Barney, I'll tell you what's the problem. You know how I was always the best single? Now I'm the best in relationship. Even better than you and Lily.," Why? Lily loves a clean sink so I do the dishes right away, what's the problem?  Look at you. You got a girlfriend for 5 minutes and you think playing in the big leagues. Adorable. Son... I'm in a relationship for your ponytail and that you were playing the guitar with Dave Matthews Mom. I am a good boyfriend when I sleep. I can do a k*ller foot massage, hand and prepare a great chamomile on the other, which would make you cry. Damn, I know more about how to make popcorn and watch movies with Sandra Bullock in that you'll ever know, but thank you to worry, blue."
Barney, Let me ask you a question.," Look at you. You got a girlfriend for 5 minutes and you think playing in the big leagues. Adorable. Son... I'm in a relationship for your ponytail and that you were playing the guitar with Dave Matthews Mom. I am a good boyfriend when I sleep. I can do a k*ller foot massage, hand and prepare a great chamomile on the other, which would make you cry. Damn, I know more about how to make popcorn and watch movies with Sandra Bullock in that you'll ever know, but thank you to worry, blue.  Go ahead."
Barney," Do you mind you, if the sink is full of dirty dishes?", Go ahead.  Not really.
Barney," So what is the problem of Lily, not yours."," Not really.  But if I said that, we will play, so..."
Barney," You argue. Robin, we do not fight."," But if I said that, we will play, so...  Of course I do."
Barney," No. And here's the secret, every time we say we're going to argue...", Of course I do.  Why is there a bag of pants marked April 2008 in your closet?
Barney, It works in 100% of cases. No fighting if you're not there.This is what Gandhi said., So when you think you will play and you get up you go?  This is not true.
Barney, Do not worry. It also has a good way to avoid arguments., I can not believe Robin supports it.  The ties go to the machine?
Barney," There's so much to do with the mouth. Why spoil it by talking? But if you insist, here's what I would say on the dishes if I was married to Lily."," But when you have a problem with Lily, it is discussed.  Barney, you came home!"
Barney, Okay.," Go to the basics!  Thank you, doll."
Barney," Thank you, doll."," Okay.  Honey, you're going to wash it?"
Barney," I'm glad you mention it. No. And that's why. I know you do not like dirty sinks. But do it for me to clean it? If one day I looked up the ceiling of the room and think, Hey, I want a replica of the Sistine Chapel is what you will paint the?"," Honey, you're going to wash it?  No. Of course not."
Barney," Exactly! Similarly, if you do not like having lots of dirty dishes, it's your washing.", No. Of course not.  Thank you explained that. I get confused easily.
Barney, It's because you're a woman., Thank you explained that. I get confused easily.  I do not even know why we laugh!
Barney, Of course not., I do not even know why we laugh!  Are you kidding me.
Barney," Once I have his attention, it's time to get out the heavy a*tillery."," Wait, Ted. Listen to the man.  Look, I love you. But, baby, with little energy I have left after work, I want to cover you with love, not washing dishes."
Barney," Look, I love you. But, baby, with little energy I have left after work, I want to cover you with love, not washing dishes."," Once I have his attention, it's time to get out the heavy a*tillery.  You're right. I'll do the dishes. Just after doing this."
Barney," Now, turn around.", You're right. I'll do the dishes. Just after doing this.  You b*at him or I do it?
Barney, The piercing was cool.," No. Marshall, look at me. Do not go into the circus of Barney Stinson, the house of mirrors and illogical logic. You got ear pierced like that in 2003.  It was cool, huh?"
Barney, You're welcome., I hate it! I hate it from the depths of my soul! I hate it! I hate it I hate it!  Okay. There you are. You're gonna tell me the truth. Barney said that you did ever played.
Barney, I told you., I think that's true.  Impossible. I love you both but you're the two biggest emotional disabilities in the history of relations. You had to play at least once.
Barney," Super. Here are your tasks for the weekend. Ted, you're gonna go see the neighbors. Marshall, you go see Lily. Robin and I need you for a crouched position on an animal skin in our chalet. Ready? Break!", Thank you.  Have fun.
Barney, Okay.," How was the trip?  We spent the weekend hugging the fireside. No black diamonds, nothing but red hearts. I'll unpack my bags."
Barney," It's not great to finally see blossomed emotionally, spiritually and sexually?", What has happened between you? When did you become disgusting?  We all came out a year.
Barney," short, and your weekend?", We all came out a year.  Terrible. And because of you! I listened to your advice stupid!
Barney, What happened to the I'm tired after my exhausting day and I want to use what little energy I have left to cover you with love?," I do not know what happened. I am a lawyer. I earn my living by arguing but when it is with Lily, I'm... confused. How not to be with her eyes and her breasts?  I should have noted."
Barney," You need to be angry. Dispute yourself stronger.Imagine that Marshall never have to wash dishes in all your life, all the plates are clean. Why, it would relieve any anxiety to any meal. Not having to tie your T-shirt to form a bowl of salted fortune for your pleasures. This world belongs to you, Marshall.Beach house, take it, put yourself in holiday clothes, benefits."," Dude, Lily is played badly. It is small... but as a vicious badger that your brother would have caught and starved for 5 days and placed in your sleeping bag. I should go and apologize.  He's right."
Barney, What do you eat?," This dish is my manhood! And I want to leave my manhood deep in the dirty sink full of ketchup and pasta...  Well shit, it's my right! I will wipe my manhood when I'm ready!"
Barney," Hey, Ro-Ro."," Where is he was not riding? Hey, Barnstormer.  You're cute nicknames? Seriously. What happens to you both?"
Barney," As Gandhi said, A smile costs nothing, baby.", Nothing. We're just happy.  I'm not sure that you know who Gandhi is.
Barney, How will Marshall and Lily?," And suddenly, I found how to get the real scoop on Barney and Robin.  Those two worry me, really."
Barney," You and your big, huge heart."," Those two worry me, really.  Enough. The game is over."
Barney, What do you mean by that?," Enough. The game is over.  Who, him?"
Barney, Who the hell is Phil?, Phil told me.  Your downstairs neighbor.
Barney, All was going well. Our techniques dodges worked perfectly until the skiing trip last weekend., And it has everything... heard. So Phil told me that Ro-Ro and Barnstormer argue... a lot. Explanations?  I found at Marshall's arguments Lily were zero then it will never have to wash another dish. Slap me in two.
Barney, I found at Marshall's arguments Lily were zero then it will never have to wash another dish. Slap me in two., All was going well. Our techniques dodges worked perfectly until the skiing trip last weekend.  It's your board that is zero.
Barney, You're on the side of Lily? You... (The chairlift stops) No. We will argue and I can not spin., It's your board that is zero.  I can not undress. It's freezing here. I'll be hypothermic.
Barney, Or so I tried the jump?, I can not undress. It's freezing here. I'll be hypothermic.  Or just the pants?
Barney, This trick of dodging is over?, Or just the pants?  I think.
Barney, You have the? This is the smallest!, I think.  They fight because of you!?
Barney, And it does not stop there. We argue non-stop since., They fight because of you!?  All the disputes that had prevented us are above benefits.The bag of panties.
Barney, The tie m*rder by Robin., All the disputes that had prevented us are above benefits.The bag of panties.  The hidden camera in the headboard.
Barney," As a quarterback to stay on top. Monday morning, he sits on an ice pack and are studying the tape of the match.", The hidden camera in the headboard.  Barney for the millionth time...
Barney," Look, we were fed up everyone to tell us how we are no relations.", I knew it! I knew you were too cute and perfect!  It was nice to be the ideal couple for one minute.
Barney, We need advice.," No, but what is your favorite.  Robin and Barney told Lily and Marshall to their disputes. And let's just say, in comparison, their quarrels dishes seemed bland."
Barney, More important than winning.," And keep in mind that the love you have for that other person is more important than winning.  Calm. Calm down. Seriously, what's the secret?"
Barney, What about now?, Good night.  I think we should talk about advantage and get down to business.
Barney," Or, there is a bench in the elevator."," I think we should talk about advantage and get down to business.  That's better. It is not the best couple in the world, so what?"
Barney, Grave. It's not a competition.," That's better. It is not the best couple in the world, so what?  We won!"
Barney," Your girlfriend? This is your girlfriend!? It is small and it's your friend? Do not humanize the enemy. But, delighted."," Children, since I know your Uncle Barney, he has always had strong views on relationships.  And yet, in fall 2009, it was he who had a girlfriend."
Barney, Come on. Open it. It's p*rn collection! Just kidding. It would be weird.," And yet, in fall 2009, it was he who had a girlfriend.  It's your p*rn collection."
Barney," This is my collection of p*rn! I offer you my p*rn. Now that it goes really well with Robin, I need more."," It's your p*rn collection.  Voluntarily, you abandon your p*rn...? You're really serious."
Barney, What does that mean?," This is obvious.  Nothing, it's just, you know, you have love handles."
Barney, What?! I have no love handles. This is ridiculous.," Nothing, it's just, you know, you have love handles.  It's nothing. Once you're with someone, it is natural to let some go. Trust me. It's been there."
Barney," We gotta go. Goodbye, my dear friends. You were always there for me. We will miss you.", He really is growing at a time.  He speaks to p*rn.

During sex, for birthdays, to annoy my mother, just before sex, on a sailboat. The day the mentor MC mailly eliminated each year, and of course... wait, because God knows it's true: fear of pregnancy."," Hey you two, smoking, like us.  And why you smoke there?"
Barney, I'm always on the verge of sleep Ted.," And why you smoke there?  Maybe that smoking is not so bad, at least it is outdoors."
Barney, And my abs muscle nicotine. I... am... muscular.," Maybe that smoking is not so bad, at least it is outdoors.  As glamorous as it might be, we all cracked after one week."
Barney," My God, I hope that Arthur is well. I reserve her office in case."," Yes, right away, and me is Marshall.  We must stop smoking."
Barney," I'm proud of you guys. I heard how it was difficult to stop smoking for as you, then the part of non-smokers, I tell you hat, so give me your cigarettes and I rid, one at a time."," Yes, we stop.  You stop my chick. (She removes the cigarette from his hands) I know I did not call you chick normally, but it does with that voice. Chick."
Barney, It's too stressful!," I can not stop now, not before the most important interview of my life. It's too stressful.  Just one."
Barney," I do not bite my nails, I try to suck the rest of nicotine on my fingers.", Barney stops eating your fingers.  Marshall pass me your plate.
Barney, What do cigarettes now? You believe they think of us?," What, you're a dinosaur?  Dude, if you do not stop moving your feet, I'll tear it off."
Barney, I have a hiding on the roof.," We will not smoke.  Oh, I woke up and I smoke. Robin, you know how it's dangerous to wake a smoker sleeps."
Barney," Oh, I woke up and I smoke. Robin, you know how it's dangerous to wake a smoker sleeps.", I have a hiding on the roof.  I bought a packet on the way home.
Barney," Come on, let's do it.", You know it's the perfect time there. For one last cigarette. The real last.  The last three.
Barney," Ted, I am happy for you. Sorry, not for you, not to be you."," She wants to do a doctorate, she reads the philosophy for fun, she finished the crossword in the Sunday New York Times.  To summarize, I have a date tonight. (We hear screaming outside) Thank you, New York! I try not to screw up."
Barney, Only two things can cause this turmoil.," Why it's almost that guys?  Ladies and gentlemen, the McLaren's hired a sexy barmaid."
Barney," Ladies and gentlemen, the McLaren's hired a sexy barmaid.", Only two things can cause this turmoil.  Look at all these guys. The sidewalk will feel the pee now.
Barney," What... are you crazy? It's a sexy barmaid. Do you know how long I've waited for me... My friends, I slept with many women in my glory days. Lawyers, professors, poets, doctors, professional riders, and animators... A butcher, a baker, a candle maker. Yes, we got to the part where it rhymes. A teacher, a restorative, an observer... A puppeteer, a croupier, a housewife, it is also a job, guys. A circuit court judge...", We'd better find a new bar.  Abbreviates!
Barney," I never, never slept with a barmaid sexy, until tonight.", Abbreviates!  It's not so sexy.
Barney, Wish me luck., No. Shut up!  It will never happen. She will pretend to enjoy yourself in the same way she has mesmerized all these geniuses.
Barney," Guess who will not fall under his spell? I will make him Do not try, baby. Papa needs a gin and tonic. And when she will, I recracherai saying Do it again.  The dominant male where it should be: on top, and after a few minutes below. Why should I do anything?"," It will never happen. She will pretend to enjoy yourself in the same way she has mesmerized all these geniuses.  Guys, what's up?"
Barney, Amateurs., Thank you.  What do you want?
Barney," Do not even try, baby. Wait, what?", What do you want?  You're going to stay there in order to be ridiculous?
Barney, Uh..., You're going to stay there in order to be ridiculous?  I do not know a Heu. It's half vodka and half-bar of yourself then?
Barney, No matter. You understand why I'm the only guy she does not know this bar?," Yeah, I'm gay. Gay for you.  Yes... You will not like the answer."
Barney, It's easy. I just have to stop wearing costumes.," My last three were former Wall Street brokers.Bastards. I swore never to go out with a guy who wears suits.  Is that all? Come on, you're always in costume."
Barney," True... But for these two... And, for that... Finally, for her... I'll stop wearing, wait..."," Is that all? Come on, you're always in costume.  We know you're gonna say costumes."
Barney, The costumes and complexed. I hate them. I hate them.," Sorry to have misjudged you. If there is a kind of men I can not stand are those in costume. Ca, and a woman who does not comply.  So, your date with Cindy?"
Barney, In costume.," Of course they were right. I had to let her go, but as your uncle Barney was discovered, it is not always easy.  None of us had seen for so long without Barney costume, and children, it was not pretty."
Barney, In costume.," So, I started the Powerpoint... (rubs Barney costume at Marshall) Barney?  We will order food."
Barney, I arrive in a second., We will order food.  Out of my way! Stay with me.It's not your time.
Barney, Out of my way! Stay with me.It's not your time.," I arrive in a second.  If someone could fix such a thing, it was the tailor personnel Barney, TV's Tim g*n."
Barney, So young. You can not do anything else?," Sorry, Barney. There is nothing more to do.  No. But we can use the buttons on this costume to another."
Barney, It can... As an organ donor?, No. But we can use the buttons on this costume to another.  The death of this suit could save the life of another.
Barney, But I... Do it., The death of this suit could save the life of another.  You do what it takes. Do not cry about it. It's silk.
Barney, Sorry. I know. I know., You do what it takes. Do not cry about it. It's silk.  We have the remains cremated. Its buttons have saved a sick jacket of the Upper East Side.
Barney, We have the remains cremated. Its buttons have saved a sick jacket of the Upper East Side.," Sorry. I know. I know.  Finally, you can abandon the quest for so-called sexy barmaid."
Barney," No. My costume gave his life for this cause, and I do not should rest before these two... Well, it... Finally,... Be it mine."," Finally, you can abandon the quest for so-called sexy barmaid.  There is absolutely right."
Barney," It was Italian. Classic, elegant. And my God he knew how to deal with women. They could not say no."," Barney, sorry about your friend. Tell me about him.  How old was he?"
Barney, 7 years. I miss him so much!, How old was he?  You should not be alone tonight. I will finish earlier.
Barney," Thank you, old friend. You go on a good sh*t."," You should not be alone tonight. I will finish earlier.  Admit it, she is sexier than me. It will not hurt me."
Barney," It was so special, you know? We should observe a minute of silence. Followed by about 20 minutes of grunting."," Children, as you guessed, it was not the night I met your mother. Although I think I saw his foot. But I approached the meeting with the woman of my dreams. And your mother... She had recovered her yellow umbrella.  I'll help you feel much better. Let me refresh."
Barney," Okay. Expected. No, this is not the bathroom. This is...", I'll help you feel much better. Let me refresh.  They are yours?
Barney, I'm the suit-sitting for someone.," They are yours?  Barney, you lied to me. You must choose immediately.Me... or costumes."
Barney," I know what you're thinking, What Barney has been drinking? This girl was hot! I might have to do it, but I did not miss anything because there is something she is not. 10 would make me a lot, but I'd rather be on my 31. It is a fact that you can not deny. Nothing goes better than n'me costume! Imagine a world where men and women are perfectly well-dressed! The delivery man in suit and tie savate, this puppy in a cross! This guy with sideburns, this baby with a pacifier! This gendarmette deliciously beautiful. Nothing goes better than n'leur costume! A first officer that I can wear, they are oh so distinguished! The perfect trick to get me a girl with father issues, navy blue or black! (2 men get out of a store with a rack filled with costumes) spy on this perfect rack! I want to make guilis."," Barney, you lied to me. You must choose immediately.Me... or costumes.  Oh, really! Then answer these questions, I beg. What would you do if you had to choose between your suits and a pot of gold?"
Barney, Costumes!," Oh, really! Then answer these questions, I beg. What would you do if you had to choose between your suits and a pot of gold?  What would you say, against all your costume you were offered eternal youth?"
Barney, Costumes!," What would you say, against all your costume you were offered eternal youth?  What would you choose: a million girls and one three parts?"
Barney, Do we see., What would you choose: a million girls and one three parts?  And a world at peace would be within your reach?
Barney," I'll stop. These are the costumes. Stops just bullshit.Two, three, four! Girls come and depart, but the clothes remain constant! Each buddy d'pote and rambling, it is no substitute!Sorry, my costumes, I give you my life. My Sunday clothes are my best friends!

Barney," With Jenkins, of Jenkins, near Jenkins. You said it, I want to put like a sock.", You want to sleep with Jenkins?  But you are... really... I did not know that...
Barney, But huh?," As the show starts early, it is often at the bar. So when she did an interview, one should drink when she says But um.At the bar...  But um, it would seem, she often said."
Barney," It's funny, I also had a drinking game based on Robin, Robin finally. At the bottom of her stomach..."," But um, it would seem, she often said.  It was agreed that you do not speak of those things."
Barney," Sorry, you're right. She did not like anyway. She said it woke her up. Does she said But um so often?"," It was agreed that you do not speak of those things.  Tonight, we saw how much she often said."
Barney," Easy, that's the plan: A, layer with Jenkins. Two, I sleep with Jenkins first. Three, the second rule is the first I'm going to rule 2."," She thinks she is strong. That's right, I have to prove that I am not the weak. I will make her jealous.  Okay, I know. You remember the other night, the game of skee-ball, when you did your good score?"
Barney," Marshall, you're in the field!"," Kissed my husband! MY HUSBAND! Nobody embraces the father of my future children besides me.  Children, your Uncle Marshall was never tried again to make your aunt Lily jealous."

Barney, Hold on to it. Never lets go! I have never seen more beautiful girls. They all work with Tiffany?, There she is. (Between Tiffany followed by several other women) It has led to colleagues.  Yep.
Barney," There can be only one explanation for that. Tiffany is a representative... e, pharmaceuticals?", Yep.  How do you know?
Barney, And you never thought to say?, How do you know?  What? It's just a job.
Barney," That a b... Since time immemorial there has always been a professional edge to which girls g*n, like Tiffany, have flocked. I'll redo the story?", What? It's just a job.  I will not say explicitly.
Barney," It began 2.5 million years ago. The man was a hunter.So the profession's sexiest moment? Picker. h*m* erectus, indeed. With improved technology, the profession's sexiest moment was changing. I'm sure it's a hernia. You can double-check? And then the man grabbed the heavens. So girls sexy stiletto heels began and became a flight attendant. I'm right and ready to f*re. Then the man said, Life is hard. I should start taking lots of drugs.  So sexy girls landed in medical offices, hot enough to make these pills erection ironically unnecessary. So today, girls are pharma's sexiest moment.", I will not say explicitly.  Hi my great darkness. How are you?
Barney," Largue Tiffany and join the Barnacle in a buffet of girls pharma. There may be loss of clothing, knees b*rned, respiratory weakness and sore abs the next day. That the world give a damn five?!"," She touched my nose.  I know you're having trouble dropping Scooter. I decided that you need training. And you say that the problem is his sad eyes? (He returns with a mini pig) Okay, shut up, woman. Now I want you to look this mini pig and you tell him it is impossible for you to be with him one day."
Barney," There's no nights like with pharma pharma because the nights never stop! Dude, I've flirted with three of them. The fantasy. In addition, my cholesterol is low. My restless legs syndrome is cured. I am more alive than ever."," Not as much. Not as much.Ted returns to McLaren's, where Barney is still there.  Friends, good news. Tiffany broke up with her boyfriend. So I'm not the hook."
Barney, Yesterday I was with this girl so sexy that pharma should call a doctor if you have no erection for more than 4h. I have no reason people?, So far. Hang in there. I will not be eternal.  There is no one. Just the girl with whom you came out recently.
Barney, It's over., Let's go have a drink.  What?
Barney, The girls of pharma are more than g*n. This is the end of an era., What?  You're a little dramatic.
Barney," Really? It starts with a Gladys. And suddenly, a few gay guys not so fabulous fall into the ranks. And before you know it, the girls look like pharma team to a Southwest flight to Albuquerque in Little Rock. It's over!", You're a little dramatic.  So that night I went to live in Henrietta prepared to release it from my hook.
Barney, I've realized that their reign had to stop to give way to a sexy new profession. It may be... communications officer in an intergalactic spaceship to a distant solar system that we can imagine. Maybe it will be... contract. It is not known. But one thing is certain. The future shines... as a huge sun throwing rays of orange light over our heads and our spirits., You still broies black to the end of the era of the daughters of pharma?  Why change your mind?
Barney," The realization that hope springs eternal. Ca and the little purple pill box found in my bag. I do not know what they are, but they are amazing!", Why change your mind?
Barney, It all started a week ago.," Okay, big guy, tell me all along.  I spent time at a local bar. Entered... a lady."
Barney, I spent time at a local bar. Entered... a lady., It all started a week ago.  Nothing is sexier than a man wearing a nice tie.
Barney, Aside from a woman who appreciates a nice tie., Nothing is sexier than a man wearing a nice tie.  But this is merely a tie.
Barney, It was not my best tie., But this is merely a tie.  Right.
Barney," So, right after that, I took her home."," Right.  When I'm in bed with a man, my body becomes a machine fueled by desire, greed and a hunger to satisfy every single... the carnal desires of my lover."
Barney," Fortunately, the cleaning lady comes tomorrow."," When I'm in bed with a man, my body becomes a machine fueled by desire, greed and a hunger to satisfy every single... the carnal desires of my lover.  Good night."
Barney," What? Wait, what? I thought your body would become a machine fueled by desire, greed and a hunger only to satisfy my every carnal desires.", Good night.  I really think Don and I found our rhythm to work.
Barney," I could be more unfortunate. All night, she goes back on me. I brought her back home and she runs away? When I loose a daughter, I am polite to sleep with her before. It is good manners."," Yeah, Barney sees girls, it could not be happier.  It looks like she has read this book, Of course you're alone, look at you, poor trail. What? It was this book that helps girls find a husband. It is that of Robin. I just laminated. Okay! Barney, when you were with this girl, she subtly used the word sex?"
Barney, Continuous. Continues.," I'm in the inter-gender-ing, and I have some sex-seconds before the light turns green. And then, everyone honks, and it really sex, but I can not run because a jogger slips and falls in the Sacraments of sex-horse.  Did she used an excuse for physical contact?"
Barney, Kashmir? This is the virgin merino hand-woven. The fibers of this costume are spaced less than 12 microns., It's the cashmere?  12 microns. I like the tight fibers.
Barney," Well, you're lucky, because mine are the tightest. And touched, they are more gentle.", 12 microns. I like the tight fibers.  She did it too!
Barney, She did it too!," Well, you're lucky, because mine are the tightest. And touched, they are more gentle.  And here's the final test. Next time, invite the following evening. The book says that it is forbidden, then surely it will give you a bogus excuse, like, I can not tomorrow night. I have already planned to clean my garage and I take a bubble bath.But why not next week?"
Barney," You try this shit of course you're alone, look at you, poor trail."," And here's the final test. Next time, invite the following evening. The book says that it is forbidden, then surely it will give you a bogus excuse, like, I can not tomorrow night. I have already planned to clean my garage and I take a bubble bath.But why not next week?  It's not crap. Sure you're alone, look at you, poor trail, is a brilliant book. And it scares the guys who only want the ass."
Barney, Did you just say you got a kid!," It's not crap. Sure you're alone, look at you, poor trail, is a brilliant book. And it scares the guys who only want the ass.  You'd be surprised how many assholes we cross. That is why my book says to never sleep at first date."
Barney, Completely., You'd be surprised how many assholes we cross. That is why my book says to never sleep at first date.  Or the second. Or the third.
Barney, Of course. Well..., Or the second. Or the third.  Or the fourth.
Barney, Just tell me how!, Or the fourth.  17.
Barney," Excuse me, someone is using this stool?", 17.  That is: no sex before hot date 17th.
Barney," I will not give up, but yes. For, thanks to the book of Ted..."," If you're not going to take her 17th hot date, you should give up.  From Robin is Robin."
Barney, I can have two sh*ts ahead. There is a flaw in there and I will get it., From Robin is Robin.  Listen... You wanna go out on Saturday night?
Barney, I can not believe. Friends... This is it! She wrote the book! It must be named Anita. My plan was to sleep with her but it changes everything. New plan: I'll sleep with her.," You have to do, okay? A great guy like Don, it's rare.And speaking of rare, first one side, do not forget. Thank you.  That girl that Barney hunting, it seems a somewhat anti-Barney. I like the way the universe has decided to collect."
Barney," This Pilates teacher broke all scores. Imagine Robin, but younger. And bigger breasts. Not bigger, but more shapely.And larger. (Robin phone) I put on the StairMaster and..."," I never thought that I would think, but... I thought about it.  It does."
Barney," Spoilers. Regardless, we did."," It does.  It's done. (Mike brings a drink to Anita) Thank you, Mike."
Barney, Shit. I read this entire book and I find no fault. What will I do?," I know, but the song is rather catchy.  There is another option... but you're not ready."
Barney, Tell me.," There is another option... but you're not ready.  If you must conclude in one hot date, a date that must be crazy. I do not speak of a restaurant-cine. Or mini golf. I speak of... 17 romantic rendezvous grouped into one incredible night. I mean... a super hot date."
Barney, A great date? It's not very catchy. And if I say a mega date?," If you must conclude in one hot date, a date that must be crazy. I do not speak of a restaurant-cine. Or mini golf. I speak of... 17 romantic rendezvous grouped into one incredible night. I mean... a super hot date.  If you want my help, it's a super hot date."
Barney, Okay.," If you want my help, it's a super hot date.  Let me do it. I will plan everything."
Barney, You're going to plan everything? This is cutesy and romantic?, Let me do it. I will plan everything.  Cutesy and romantic? (He starts singing) No need to take him to Paris or Peru...
Barney, What are you doing?, Cutesy and romantic? (He starts singing) No need to take him to Paris or Peru...  You just gotta make him understand...
Barney, They look at us., You just gotta make him understand...  How important it is for you...
Barney, Really? You really gonna do that?," How important it is for you...  In your super hot date, Global problems will simply be put aside, for wonders and surprises that will be the stars. Hurry, do not be late because together, you will find a country where paradise is rebukes. And then, boom! Fireworks in the sky over Manhattan! You kiss him. And your super hot date."
Barney, It looks to me like cutesy and romantic. Box strip?," In your super hot date, Global problems will simply be put aside, for wonders and surprises that will be the stars. Hurry, do not be late because together, you will find a country where paradise is rebukes. And then, boom! Fireworks in the sky over Manhattan! You kiss him. And your super hot date.  Box strip."
Barney, Why did you do that?," I'm fine, I'm fine.  Because I am angry against you. And against me. Ted and cons. And frankly, I still am against the Empire."
Barney, Why are you angry against me?," Because I am angry against you. And against me. Ted and cons. And frankly, I still am against the Empire.  You were a real assh*le to Robin when she was in her period of mourning."
Barney, The period of mourning? She has not had a period of mourning., You were a real assh*le to Robin when she was in her period of mourning.  You see nothing.
Barney," What, she is upset?"," Barney, sit down, there are two three things to tell you.  Of course she is upset. Look at you, poor trail."
Barney, You should have seen., Then Aunt Lily told Barney all the little details of what he had not seen since the break.  I'm going.
Barney, We go back home..., I'm going.  I can not believe that Robin is upset.
Barney, I can not believe that Robin is upset., We go back home...  And hast me you vomit in your Stormtrooper helmet.
Barney, I did worse after the premiere of The Phantom Menace.It's been like that since we broke up?," And hast me you vomit in your Stormtrooper helmet.  Well, it was much better before you decide to go to your stupid super hot date with Anita. And now she broods, God knows where."
Barney, I know where.," Well, it was much better before you decide to go to your stupid super hot date with Anita. And now she broods, God knows where.  Barney, what's up? I thought you had a super hot date."
Barney, I know you're upset.," Barney, what's up? I thought you had a super hot date.  What? No. I've never been happier. Anita and this seems great. I'm so glad... by the merest chance, you found yourself. It warms my f*cking heart."
Barney, You sure you're not upset?," What? No. I've never been happier. Anita and this seems great. I'm so glad... by the merest chance, you found yourself. It warms my f*cking heart.  Of course I do. Do not you see how to talk continually of your conquests makes me feel like another number for you?"
Barney, You're not another number for me.," Of course I do. Do not you see how to talk continually of your conquests makes me feel like another number for you?  And now you to take Anita you barely know, this extraordinary hot date, then you do not ever offered me that. It's just that... It sucks, that's all. It sucks."
Barney," I knew I was a bad boyfriend, but I had no idea that I was worse in the former boyfriend. I'm sorry. How can I be forgiven?"," And now you to take Anita you barely know, this extraordinary hot date, then you do not ever offered me that. It's just that... It sucks, that's all. It sucks.  Nothing, Barney. You've already proven I'm not important to you."
Barney," Stop saying that, I'm serious. Ask me what you want."," Nothing, Barney. You've already proven I'm not important to you.  Do not sleep with Anita."
Barney, I promise., Do not sleep with Anita.  Of course you'll sleep with her. Why is this super hot date if not?
Barney, It will not go super hot date. It is you who will go.," Of course you'll sleep with her. Why is this super hot date if not?  Your uncle Barney gave Robin finally the super hot date she deserved. With a guy she deserved. Of course, there was a detail to be resolved."
Barney, I wanted to call you.," Your uncle Barney gave Robin finally the super hot date she deserved. With a guy she deserved. Of course, there was a detail to be resolved.  I violate any rules in my coming here, but... no one asks me rabbit like that, so we go out or not?"
Barney," I'm sorry, I... I made a promise to a friend. I must say no."," I violate any rules in my coming here, but... no one asks me rabbit like that, so we go out or not?  I see. You try the trick of no. You really think it'll work?Because it will not work. Okay, I'll make a deal. Maybe... you might get lucky after the 12th hot date."
Barney, No.," I see. You try the trick of no. You really think it'll work?Because it will not work. Okay, I'll make a deal. Maybe... you might get lucky after the 12th hot date.  The 11th?"
Barney, No., The 11th?  The fifth?
Barney, No., The fifth?  Tonight?
Barney, No., Tonight?  This evening before dinner?
Barney, No., This evening before dinner?  And you? You're interested.
Barney, I'm sorry. The answer is no.," Go.  Well. Because my answer is no, too. This is my last offer."
Barney, Here is my story.," Well. Because my answer is no, too. This is my last offer.  This is a $ 500 fine for having jumped into the river. I hope it was worth it."
Barney, I hope so too., This is a $ 500 fine for having jumped into the river. I hope it was worth it.  This is an old story of married women.
Barney, Why?," I want the perfect group sh*t. Marshall put yourself between Robin and Barney.  You know... Light, color, balance, aperture..."
Barney, How dare you?, Of course. You will not last! The photo is forever.  It's so rude.
Barney, It's true.," It's so rude.  Totally. It is a tightrope, but still."
Barney," No, it was me. And I meant it."," I would say Amanda.  Well, I'm going to finish the cake."
Barney, I Can Vote? Street bitch! Street bitch!," Or we could continue the descent on the Avenue Best Birthday.  My friends, I made a song for tonight. Follow me, the chorus is this: Merry, Merry Lily-anniversary..."
Barney, You remember the yoga teacher that got you into my birthday?," Almost. This is Leilani. She had to come at Christmas because, you said, Folks, this may be good. And this is not the only maybe good. Eve 2007, Barney, Lily, Robin, Ted, Marshall and It's good Emily. The funeral of Uncle Cecil Robin, Marshall, Lily, Robin, Barney, Ted and... It proves that you selected the eyes closed Isabelle. My appendicitis, Robin, Marshall, Barney, Lily, Ted, and it... you've admitted, you just wanted to make. Compliance.  Thank you. You believe not just enter. Look! Look! Why not look at you! This is Slash from g*n N'Roses!"
Barney, Thank you. You believe not just enter. Look! Look! Why not look at you! This is Slash from g*n N'Roses!, You remember the yoga teacher that got you into my birthday?  Group Photo!
Barney," And we have had. We had a group photo with Slash on my birthday. Great, huh? Eh?"," Group Photo!  It was there, we know the end."
Barney, False!," It was there, we know the end.  The funny for this photo. I plottait ass."
Barney, And me too. He has how many hands?, Oh? So do I.  Normal if it is good guitarist.
Barney," Yes, at this point, I have never an old head on the photos. Neither ever or always.", Wait. Look at these pictures. Barney always has the same pose and all these years.  It's gotta be a lousy picture of you.
Barney," Nope, not at all.", It's gotta be a lousy picture of you.  And in elementary school? We all have school pictures ugly.
Barney," Not the Barnacle. I always look awesome mortally. Not like Marshall, who seems to be ingeniously death."," And in elementary school? We all have school pictures ugly.  He was right. Your uncle Marshall is many things well, but for the pictures, it's terrible."
Barney, You really put a knot!," They are not all bad. Like... this. Look. I have my eyes open.  A crisp, Barney?"
Barney, Of course.," A crisp, Barney?  I! A photo ugly."
Barney, You sure?, I! A photo ugly.  No! Wait! You ate a potato chips! Where's the chips?
Barney, It's physically impossible for me to take a picture ugly. I know why. Ask God.," No! Wait! You ate a potato chips! Where's the chips?  Lily, sorry for Amanda. But I'll say. You make your spoiled rotten. You in all your statements because you think I messed up two three photos?"
Barney, You sure?," It's terrible. My laptop is just... fell. You me collected?(Barney looks to pick it up) Mouse, f*ck! I!  Wait. How you do that?! You were not even standing!"
Barney," The camera loves me. Much more than that. The device I want. The unit wants to put on underwear, put an Al Green CD, dim the lights and do all the work while I was still lying with closed eyes."," Wait. How you do that?! You were not even standing!  I feel sorry for Paris and group photos ruined, but... when you're single, you must hope that every girl is good. I mean, Erin.Irene."
Barney, They would be if Marshall was not on it.," Sorry that my search for love has you so upset. You know, your precious photos might be better if I was not over.  Cheap sh*t. Low blow."
Barney, It is said that it was after 40 years we know each other really., I think Lori's age made him very wise.  So your aunt Lily called Amanda.
Barney, What? Where?," It's a hole in your jacket?  Now, Marshall!"
Barney, Is there anything in the sauce that you've made? It tastes like... coriander. And... you know that cilantro makes me...," Come on, everybody. Come here. Let's make a memory.  Yes!"
Barney, I love traveling., No one played as well as Barney with this limit. A breeze for him.  Really? What is the best place that you hast visited?
Barney," Hawaii is fun. A buddy of mine lives in Seattle. It's really not bad. But the best place? I must say, the moon.", Really? What is the best place that you hast visited?  You're not convinced a girl that you were the first to walk on the moon? It was seven years before you were born.
Barney," Ted, a blonde, it's easy."," You're not convinced a girl that you were the first to walk on the moon? It was seven years before you were born.  Our ship is passed through a hole spatiotemporal or gamma rays or something. I started to rejuvenate, blah, blah, blah. So you bump into one store yoghurt. It must be insane."
Barney," Our ship is passed through a hole spatiotemporal or gamma rays or something. I started to rejuvenate, blah, blah, blah. So you bump into one store yoghurt. It must be insane."," Ted, a blonde, it's easy.  But I worked at a yogurt shop in high school. And indeed, it was... insane."
Barney," So, after 20 minutes, the eagle has landed. We fuse into space. Houston, we have a complainer. Other double entender related to space."," But I worked at a yogurt shop in high school. And indeed, it was... insane.  Why are you lying all the time?"
Barney," I do not lie! We made love, I have pictures!", Why are you lying all the time?  I hate my job.
Barney," I'm not saying he loves pizza, but the last time he went, the doctor said, stop eating pizza. Marshall: Why? Doc: To you examine.  But seriously, we laugh because we love you."," Our coupons are your effigy.  Okay, so I have no money on me... it's because... I was as*ault."
Barney, Who? He wore a black hat and beard of the day? He said Hands up! ?," Did you get mugged?  Yes, because I was as*ault in'47 at the corner of Abbott and Costello. But no. I cut through Central Park back from work."
Barney, It was downright terrifying., It was downright terrifying.  What are you doing?
Barney, I repeat. I will say that it happened to me to lie on compassion., What are you doing?  It will not work. If?
Barney, I just want to forget what happened and continue to live my life. It's great. But I think I'll add a tear.," Okay, you know what? We'll all calm down. We do not need a g*n. I just want to forget what happened and continue to live my life.  Listen baby, I know it's scary, but look at me. I'm fine.You can put this behind us?"
Barney, It's gold! But I'd rather say 'put me behind you.," Listen baby, I know it's scary, but look at me. I'm fine.You can put this behind us?  Baby, do not worry for me, I mean, yes, I'm a little scared, but I am New York. I will not let me change it."
Barney, So it was indeed a black bonnet. J'l'avais said!," I know. I know. Listen, I must confess something. This att*ck did not go exactly as I said.  He wore no black cap. It is wearing nothing at all."
Barney, I do not ask where he kept his w*apon., He as*ault you naked?  We're sure it was a w*apon?
Barney, You're telling us..., It's good. It's good.  What you got mugged...
Barney, You've been mugged by a monkey?," For a monkey. I got mugged by a monkey.  Yeah, I got mugged by a monkey. I was embarrassed, so I invented another story. The important, Lily, you do not need a w*apon."
Barney, Why did not you asked the guard to recover your wallet?, This monkey has our address. And if it belonged to a g*ng?I hope he will climb to see us.  Because I saw that the monkey did and I wanted more after.
Barney, New information has been discovered on the att*ck on Marshall.," Hi, friends. What's new?  Really? They caught him?"
Barney," No, I said. This is my story. You see, the young Marshall was at the zoo, eating a banana..."," Okay. That's what happened.  I ate no banana! If you tell it, do it well."
Barney, You're right. The banana was on the floor.," I ate no banana! If you tell it, do it well.  Was not... Was not banana banana."
Barney," Marshall, I'm sorry, really. Here's what happened.", Was not... Was not banana banana.  Do not sh**t. There was no banana!
Barney, I've just been mugged., You've been mugged by a monkey.Barney entered the apartment while Ted is sitting on the couch.  What?
Barney, That's what I said to the girl at the bar just now..., What?  It was downright terrifying. I would just like to forget what happened and continue to live my life.
Barney, It was downright terrifying. I would just like to forget what happened and continue to live my life., That's what I said to the girl at the bar just now...  My poor darling.
Barney," Well, my name is not Neil. This is Bar...", Neil? Neil!  Why you call it Neil?
Barney," Well, I can do. You see, I was on the road to the launch pad when I got mugged. And the aggressor... took my keys from the shuttle. Successful. Who wants to do something to 3?", You've just mugged?  Me.
Barney, And it was the best thing in my life 3.," Me too.  Funny, you look like you just got two vodka and tonic in the face."
Barney," The story is better with my end... It's... Okay? So we were there, zero gravity. They wore helmets that astronauts..."," You're the lemon in your hair.  Marshall, you never will believe. I spoke to my producer monkey aggressor and he loves!"
Barney, So what you're saying is that you got the monkey trapped so you give him your wallet?," Not at all.  No, that's not it."
Barney," You sure it was not a monkey on the shoulders of another monkey, wearing a trench coat?"," Guys, there was no monkey! He was a man with a g*n.  That would be the right size."
Barney, I can not believe.," I just invented this story that Lily does not buy a w*apon. In truth, it never happened.  What?"
Barney, You heard me. You got att*cked by a monkey. You want to go to the issuance of Robin because you're afraid of being ridiculous., What?  I would not?
Barney," If serious, this is too funny."," I would not?  Well, this has never happened. And I can lie to you because you are my best friends."
Barney," I, yes, but still."," Well, this has never happened. And I can lie to you because you are my best friends.  But I can not lie on national TV."
Barney, You know a long time. He told the truth?," But I can not lie on national TV.  Ted, do not do that..."
Barney, I still say that it happened.," I could not say. It smells good. But I could not say.  Maybe. But, Marshall, if you have not been att*cked by a monkey, Robin must not speak on his show. It would be more credible."
Barney," Journalists lie constantly. Sorry, but I believe that Jack Palance is d*ad when I see the body."," Maybe. But, Marshall, if you have not been att*cked by a monkey, Robin must not speak on his show. It would be more credible.  It will perhaps shock you Barney, but people do not like lying to them."
Barney," False! They like to discover that they lied. Because a lie is just a great story that has mixed with the truth. Barney Stinson. Example, that Sarah gave me this!"," It will perhaps shock you Barney, but people do not like lying to them.  You mean what you done to him."
Barney," No, I mean what she did. In truth, I fear that history has not gone exactly as I said."," You mean what you done to him.  Passed. Who wants to do something to 3? (The two women throw their glasses to him the figure) Lisa, wait."
Barney," Passed. Who wants to do something to 3? (The two women throw their glasses to him the figure) Lisa, wait."," No, I mean what she did. In truth, I fear that history has not gone exactly as I said.  Yes, Neil?"
Barney," It's you Lisa? Sarah, wait. Listen. I'm Neil Armstrong.Sorry I lied."," Yes, Neil?  Well, I think I have not been completely honest with you either. I said I was 28, but in truth, I'm 31."
Barney," 31 years! I was happy, very happy, thinking that because I put a 28 year old daughter who has taken too much sun. People want to lie. Marshall, they need the lie, that's why, in my case, you've been mugged by a monkey. As far as I'm done with this plan 3. I am the best in the world!"," Well, I think I have not been completely honest with you either. I said I was 28, but in truth, I'm 31.  This is the belt of Planar 3?"
Barney, You know it., This is the belt of Planar 3?  Well done! I have too much sleep last night. Can you imagine that I almost buy a g*n? I'm glad you as*ault by a monkey.
Barney, Yeah! I knew it., You got me. I was just nervous. I got mugged by a monkey.  Now I think you're not really mugged by a monkey.
Barney," Come on, Ted. Why he would invent something like that?"," Now I think you're not really mugged by a monkey.  Come on, Ted."
Barney," Dude, what do you do?"," It's you who will be covered by the sheet if you leave your model not stupid.  I do not think Marshall will lie on TV. And when it gives up, I wanna be there for Robin, with a story. Or rather, 102 stories, because it is the height of a building in New York."
Barney, Now I want a w*apon.," I do not think Marshall will lie on TV. And when it gives up, I wanna be there for Robin, with a story. Or rather, 102 stories, because it is the height of a building in New York.  The monkey is there."
Barney, You know if it was att*cked?, No! I have not been mugged!  I have no idea.
Barney, It was not very satisfactory. When I tell that he was att*cked by a monkey. And I keep the stuff of banana. It was good.," Micro and makeup in place. The socks of the arch duchess.  Barney, stop lying. You can not put another end because the conclusion does not satisfy you."
Barney," Really? Well, believe me, Mosby. One day you shall tell this story and you'll see things my way."," Barney, stop lying. You can not put another end because the conclusion does not satisfy you.  I doubt it."
Barney," Of course, Ted.", It's really happening?  True story.
Barney,... seen.,"... never...  Hello everyone. Mahallow to be there with us. Throughout my life, well, this life. I waited a muse as Virginia. Girl... this is your song."
Barney," Guys, guys! Guess what Robin has done.", And Mahatma Gandhi. And pancakes. Well all together! And the dragon. And you.  You're currently whining?
Barney, You're currently whining?," Guys, guys! Guess what Robin has done.  I know it's stupid, but... And the dragon. They are happy, you know?"
Barney," Not as much as me, Robin. Guys, guys! Guess what Robin has done."," I know it's stupid, but... And the dragon. They are happy, you know?  And then I just tell you guys what Robin has done, but you were there for. I must tell you the rest of the wedding. Aunt Meredith!"
Barney," And then I just tell you guys what Robin has done, but you were there for. I must tell you the rest of the wedding. Aunt Meredith!"," Not as much as me, Robin. Guys, guys! Guess what Robin has done.  Children, I can not exaggerate how horrible it is to be a single guy in his mother's second marriage."
Barney," Robin whining during the song Clint. Oh, I've already said. The super good sister of Ted, Heather!", You marry when?  I gotta go.
Barney," Uncle Larry, sky gods. Niagara Falls. It is empty."," Ted, Ted, what are you doing? It is the marriage of your mother!  And my friends I have not seen during the next 72 hours."
Barney, Sorry Robin. They are all out of pretzels. And I know how you're emotional. (He gives her a stack of paper towels) Shh. Leave it alone.," I know. His mother called such five times to ask where he was.  Okay! Okay, I... I cried during the song Clint."
Barney, She cried to the song of Clint.," Okay! Okay, I... I cried during the song Clint.  Hi, guys."
Barney," And that was fine with Blair Witch, and she tried to haggle on closing costs?"," I mean, I put an online auction and I won the next day and I was accepted. I have just finalized all the paperwork.  Try not to laugh with you that, man."
Barney," Is it in the room with us right now, Ted?"," I'm an architect. I would find a way. And if I start now, this is over so that my wife and I can move.  Okay, okay. I know. I have not found Ms. Mosby yet, but I will get it. Knock on wood."
Barney, The dumbest thing that ON've ever done.," Yeah, I agree. This is perhaps the dumbest thing you've ever done.  Okay, well. Ted let alone a little, right?"
Barney," No, it's too dumb to whether adult. It should be child when it happened."," My God, you had to be completely stuffed.  Children? Why..."
Barney, Put rockets in...," Children? Why...  Oh, my God, guys! Great new game: Drunk or child? I was what? Guess."
Barney, Gamin., Bourre.  Gamin.
Barney," You know, I'm glad Robin have guessed. Because it is really sensitive and fragile. I talk about the times she cried during the song Clint. And while I whisper, I hope she hears me."," Drum roll, please. I was... Drunk!  It was not me!"
Barney," I know it's silly, but... And the dragon. They are happy, you know?", Are you crying?  Not as much as me.
Barney, I shall spin you 500 dollars if it happened to you instead of me., Not as much as me.  $ 500? No worries.
Barney," Thank you, Robin. You saved me an explanation and an excruciating public humiliation. Guys! Guys! Guess what Robin has done."," $ 500? No worries.  Wait, you're..."
Barney," Wait, you're..."," Thank you, Robin. You saved me an explanation and an excruciating public humiliation. Guys! Guys! Guess what Robin has done.  Hi, I'm here for inspection."
Barney," Wait, wait. You will inspect the place where now?"," Oh, hey! The doorbell does not work.  Well, yeah."
Barney," It was Robin! What! Yes, it was Robin who cried at the song Clint! But she said... I know what she said. But that's not what she wanted you to know."," But Marshall took the risk, and that's the best thing that ever happened to you both.  Look, Barney, I support most all these jokes about me crying. And if I claim to prove it was you who was crying, that you would not be a problem?"
Barney, Of course.," Look, Barney, I support most all these jokes about me crying. And if I claim to prove it was you who was crying, that you would not be a problem?  I made a mistake in letting you go, right? Your penis is huge."
Barney, Shit.," You're always a little too far.  Well, good news. I think we all will soon be out of here."
Barney, I see a complaint.," Ok, yes. There are problems. But I see this house as I know it can be. I see a swing on the tree outside. I see a crown on the front door at Christmas. I see a barbecue outside on the patio or I would make Barbec every weekend. I see a life I know I can be here.  Found termites."
Barney, Thank you. My God.," You were right. It was a huge mistake. It's just that... the world is changing, but me... You have a flat 'for years. It's getting serious between Robin and Don. Barney, perhaps this is a new tie?  Now my mother remarried. I... I'm exactly the same spot 5 years ago. I'm tired. I'm... I'm ready for life that goes with this house."
Barney," OK, buddy. Sometimes people make bad decisions in life. Like your mother.", Now my mother remarried. I... I'm exactly the same spot 5 years ago. I'm tired. I'm... I'm ready for life that goes with this house.  What do you mean?
Barney," Ted, as you know, I've always been really, really addicted to your mother."," What do you mean?  Please, stop."
Barney," Actually, Virginia and I spent a special time in 2006.Before Clint."," Please, stop.  What are you talking about?"
Barney, I wanted to be your father!, What are you talking about?  What does that mean?
Barney," Do not answer me, young man. That's why I cried at the song of Clint. Because that bastard stole your mother. And now all that remains for me... is the memory of the drop at the airport.", What does that mean?  And that's how you got the pin? Incredible. You... So... here we go.
Barney, And that's how you got the pin? Incredible. You... So... here we go.," Do not answer me, young man. That's why I cried at the song of Clint. Because that bastard stole your mother. And now all that remains for me... is the memory of the drop at the airport.  Here we go."
Barney, It is a good time. Not much traffic...," Here we go.  Oh, I love this song."
Barney, Is it true? Hmm. I can... Listen... Ted's mother. I... I should really...," Oh, I love this song.  Your penis is huge."
Barney," Okay, that's good. Well, I invented the last, but everything else, I swear it was true. Come on, man. Your mother is a cougar."," Again?! One too many!  Wait, I thought you said that a cougar could not be more than 50 years."
Barney," Okay, this is a Mellencamp."," Wait, I thought you said that a cougar could not be more than 50 years.  Guys, I'm in trouble. I mean, the best I can do is to improve the house and sell the property with great losses."
Barney, Your mother and I were at second base., It's silly.  Thank you Lily. It was fantastic.
Barney," You think about it? You hardly know him. In addition, the guy is a draw with a job that is worthless."," I thought about it.  We have the same job, Barney."
Barney," And we could not be more proud of you, my angel."," We have the same job, Barney.  It still seems fast."
Barney," All right. As a former... before you embark on anything, I'm meeting this guy. I think it's pretty weird not having yet met."," Why not let the solid brick to remind us not to buy?  Bluntly. It's as if someone was orchestrating things for this specific purpose. Okay, but you must promise to behave well."
Barney, I promise.," Bluntly. It's as if someone was orchestrating things for this specific purpose. Okay, but you must promise to behave well.  I'm doing this contortionist Portuguese, and I swear... it is so flexible, at a time, it was about me and beneath me. A top and a bottom! One and two! Which is empty?"
Barney," I'm doing this contortionist Portuguese, and I swear... it is so flexible, at a time, it was about me and beneath me. A top and a bottom! One and two! Which is empty?", I promise.  It's good.
Barney," I appreciate you, Don. Both, we love a good scotch, one likes my stories compelling. And we went out with Robin."," Robin had never told Don she was out with Barney.  There, he knew it."
Barney," In short, the arms of the Erasmus student have dropped and there fell of my swing. Seriously, I have not found a girl who can do that from Robin."," The'm not, it's as if we had never been together.  How was your weekend, or any other topic?"
Barney," Well, there you should also apologize. We said some pretty hurtful.", I came to apologize to you. I exaggerated.  Not at all.
Barney, That was after you to be part., Not at all.  Sorry for not having told the truth from the beginning.
Barney," I can not wait, buddy.", It's great.  Thank you.
Barney, I have to get Robin.," So long, guys.  Are you kidding?"
Barney," I do not know what it is, but I want to get Robin.", Are you kidding?  I know what it is. You're like... a kid who threw his toys and wants them back as soon as another plays with.
Barney, I had perhaps not done playing with. I just left to play with something else for a while., I know what it is. You're like... a kid who threw his toys and wants them back as soon as another plays with.  You ready.
Barney, Ready for what?, You ready.  To read the letter.
Barney, Hanging out with Robin was a huge mistake., When Barney and Robin have broken in the fall before...  Write it.
Barney, What?, Write it.  Write yourself a letter. That way you will remember the reasons for the break when you miss.
Barney, My pleasure. Dear Barney... the future... This ink is too cool., Write yourself a letter. That way you will remember the reasons for the break when you miss.  Right?
Barney, You... and Robin...," Right? ... a couple were atrocious. It did not work. You always love Robin, but remember the other women... And above all, the other breast, and all the cool stuff you do with breasts... Y to the head, juggle... squeaker squeaker... I'm a hopeless romantic.And there are drawings of breasts."
Barney,"... a couple were atrocious. It did not work. You always love Robin, but remember the other women... And above all, the other breast, and all the cool stuff you do with breasts... Y to the head, juggle... squeaker squeaker... I'm a hopeless romantic.And there are drawings of breasts.", You... and Robin...  Get it?
Barney, I understand. I really want it back.," Get it?  Humans are not made to share a bed. Sex and sleep are associated, but these are two different things."
Barney, It's too easy.," Don made sushi, it's cool, huh? He learned in Japan.  Be nice. You want it just because you can not have it. Like saying Sit wherever you want, except on that chair. You will be so..."
Barney, My chair!," Be nice. You want it just because you can not have it. Like saying Sit wherever you want, except on that chair. You will be so...  From spicy tuna? My favorite."
Barney," Me too, man. More than you, certainly. Instance. Super spicy. I feel bad."," I do too. It is more spicy, the better.  You will not believe. Don also has twin beds."
Barney, This pepper is an ice cube in my mouth.," It yes, with his personal trainer.  But if Robin decides to move, I bought a giant bed."
Barney, Don Tokyo... You ever do that... in Japan? Wasabi!, If you moved in.  Great! Give her milk!
Barney, I stay on my position. It was bold and romantic.," Well, I hope you're happy.  You were emptied from the top and bottom."
Barney, Come on. Did you do stupid stuff to impress Robin.," You were emptied from the top and bottom.  Yes, but not anymore, because I turned the page. Just like you."
Barney," You have not turned the page. You want it as much as me, but you not admit it."," Yes, but not anymore, because I turned the page. Just like you.  That's ridiculous and I'll tell you why."
Barney, For my biographer?," That's ridiculous and I'll tell you why.  Concentrate on the letter, ok? At Ted, Robin is the ideal girl for you, but she will not engage. You need someone who wants to settle. So, until Robin is ready for this, it is not for you. I still remember stealing the blue French horn, our first kiss, her eyes when she told me she loved me. And shit. I want it back."
Barney,"... I want to sleep with her, at least one last time. She is mine!"," I stole a blue french horn for her... I was with her for a year.I wanted her to be the mother of my children and spend eternity in his arms.  It's not for you! And it's not mine, either. It is... to Don."
Barney," Okay. We must get rid of him. You know, metaphorically."," It's not for you! And it's not mine, either. It is... to Don.  Of course."
Barney," Or... literally. That's how it starts! I'm afraid, Teddy!", Of course.  We all talk!
Barney, Robin Stinson!, Come here.  Robin Mosby!
Barney, Robin Stinson!, Robin Mosby!  Ted Scherbatsky. I would take his name. I do not care.
Barney," Okay, wait. What do you say to that? It is being shared?I take up to 40 years and after you can have it.", Ted Scherbatsky. I would take his name. I do not care.  Who we laugh? It is with Don. We must accept it and move on.
Barney, You're right. I go to you... I go to the bathroom. And then I'll break..., Who we laugh? It is with Don. We must accept it and move on.  It's BarnExclussif.
Barney, It's BarnExclussif.," You're right. I go to you... I go to the bathroom. And then I'll break...  BarnExclussif, not quit. I have a double appeal."
Barney," Ted calls you? Indeed, he has a problem."," No. Ted, not quit. I'll remember. Ted is on the other line... and I think he has a problem.  What's the matter?"
Barney, It's true. I'm going to leave before something regrettable.," We almost lose control.  Robin, I love you!"
Barney," Robin, I love you!", It's true. I'm going to leave before something regrettable.  Species of bastard! I brought the blue French horn!
Barney," I brought the blue French horn! Ted has just given me.Sorry, I was there before you."," Species of bastard! I brought the blue French horn!  Guys, what do you do?"
Barney," All right! Here we go! You, Me and Ted!"," Come on, get.  Something to three."
Barney, We won the fingers in the nose...," You abandoned easily. Game, set and match!  Where's this great TV?"
Barney," Good night, Dad."," You're welcome. Good night, guys.  It was good. Well, you gotta go."
Barney, Dad?," The Teddy Bear, BarnExclussif.  We get up, f*ck. You remember last night?"
Barney," Damn, Ted was torn. Embarrassing..."," We get up, f*ck. You remember last night?  I'm sorry. It is both. We drank and we were stupid, but... We will do everything we can to ensure that Don is part of the group."
Barney, So what's going on with Robin?," Don will not be part of the group. Neither do I. At least for a while. Guys... with Don, it works well. I want to see where it goes. And I could not do it if I continue to hang out with my ex. It will not. I moved in with Don.  You were right, she was just angry. It's been four days and not talk to relocate. We must never repeat this kind of shit."
Barney," I agree. In fact... I even wrote another letter. Dear Barney the future, you think you want to get Robin, thou wilt not true. Let her. Sincerely, Barney's past."," You were right, she was just angry. It's been four days and not talk to relocate. We must never repeat this kind of shit.  Let me see!"
Barney, Give me that.," Let me see!  Ps... The top was for Ted. He believed? Fine. Pull yourself together with Robin, but say nothing to Ted because he will still go wrong. And there are still drawings of breasts."
Barney," In my defense, the breasts, is not it great?"," Ps... The top was for Ted. He believed? Fine. Pull yourself together with Robin, but say nothing to Ted because he will still go wrong. And there are still drawings of breasts.  Too great."
Barney, Guess what I have behind my back.," Guess what I have behind my back.  Wait, wait. I will find. Left."
Barney, Not a good game but okay. Five tickets well placed to Robots vs. Wrestlers.," Wait, wait. I will find. Left.  Robots vs. Wrestlers?"
Barney, You know Robots vs. Wrestlers?, Great!  No.
Barney," That's exactly it, according to the website!"," But we think some kind of sport in which robots wrestlers.  Wait, wait. Who is the fifth ticket?"
Barney," Uh... Robin. I know... She lives with her boyfriend and she said not wanting to hang out with us, but it's Robots vs. Wrestlers. Robots vs.... Wrestlers!"," Wait, wait. Who is the fifth ticket?  Barney is right. It is impossible to deny that."
Barney, She said no? How could she? Robots vs. Wrestlers of our tradition is the largest group.," You too. I gotta go. It is called? (She hangs up) Sorry, New York, I had to answer. Where were we? Bus accident.  Tradition? It was never done."
Barney," It's Robots vs. Wrestlers, Lily. This is obviously a tradition. It starts like this. First, Robin moves in with Don and Marshall and Lily have a baby, then Ted...", Tradition? It was never done.  Goes?
Barney," I was going to say was found eaten by her cats, but it's not good either. Everybody leaves me, and I like it!", Goes?  Do not worry about a baby on our side. It is not yet started.
Barney, You're right. I exaggerate with this story of Robin. What is an announcement? Wife Robin Don. I'll die alone! Ted eventually eaten by her cats!," I try to add some class to our meetings. It's like this quote from Dante's Inferno. Consider the race of which you are created not to live like brutes but to follow virtue and knowledge.Or, in Italian original...  Relax... It's for Marissa Heller."
Barney," Marissa Heller? She looks good. Face, breasts, describe. Begins with the breasts.", Relax... It's for Marissa Heller.  Who is Marissa Heller?
Barney, We change the plan for Saturday. Evening Marissa Heller for alcohol and Robots vs. Wrestlers. But one of us should pretend to Marissa Heller., It's about an open bar.  I'm flattered but Lily should.
Barney," Guys, we get together. Lil, you can do... All you have to watch the guy in front, say your name is Marissa Heller, and it passes. And I repeat, to be sure, no accent."," I just got a text from Robin. It says...  It is certain that it is not English, though? Okay! I do. I go there. (A young woman arrives) Sorry. Go ahead."
Barney," I do we go to the party, that's what! (He goes to Marissa) We met at the meeting of ornithophilic.", What do we do?  I do not believe.
Barney, Lovers of wicker?, I do not believe.  No.
Barney," No, no. It works."," And some French influence inside! He was an architect with a poet's soul, really.  I must make a confession. It is not on the list, but I always wanted to see the inside of Alberta."
Barney, I said I'd get us.," So, this way. We are together.  So... nobody saw The Young and the Restless?"
Barney, In a coined word assh*le-Apocalypse.," I'm not dressed for it.  This is Peter Bogdanovich, talking to Arianna Huffington and Will Shortz, crossword editors of The New York Times! Try at least, Chow and alcohol free. 20 minutes and off we go."
Barney, This morning I made the heart of the Ambassador of the Netherlands. I hope he gets better., He will watch it.  Really? A colleague of mine was prescribed Coumadin. And it is impossible it should be anticoagulated and if she had surgery.
Barney," As Undersecretary of Finance, I had a great influence on this legislation. Now, I wonder if you will accompany me in the map room to stimulate my package."," Films... right? Actors. Willem Dafoe. Fun Fact of Willem Dafoe, his name sounds a bit like a frog, a parrot that talks. Willem Dafoe...! Willem Dafoe...!  I do not think, my dear. You're too old for me."
Barney," Zsa Zsa Gabor is still sexy, but other than that, it is rotten this holiday."," I do not think, my dear. You're too old for me.  We tried, it's been 20 minutes. We are going. Where is Ted?"
Barney," But you never missed Robots vs. Wrestlers. It happens that way. First Robin us loose, and now you? And for those pretentious snobs and old game?"," Look, I'm having fun here, so I'll pass Robots vs. Wrestlers.  Actually, I like those pretentious snobs and they are not old fashioned fart noise when I open my mouth. I remain. See you tomorrow."
Barney, It's an evening.," Actually, I like those pretentious snobs and they are not old fashioned fart noise when I open my mouth. I remain. See you tomorrow.  It means nothing."
Barney," It means everything. If you come not to Robots vs. Wrestlers, it's the end of our friendship.", It means nothing.  See you tomorrow.
Barney," All right. So you do most of our group, forever. You can ask to return in 2 years. Come see wrestlers fight like robots. I'm embarrassed. I forgot something.Barney taps the gong and enters the elevator with Marshall and Lily.", See you tomorrow.  Where did your buddies?
Barney," You crazy not me, Marshall. Let's be honest. The group is finite. Ted is gone, like Robin. That separates us as well."," The best tradition of all time!  Boy, Barney, stop with your abandonment issues. Ted has the right to have a life outside the group. As we all."
Barney," Wait. Why do you say that all of a sudden? My God, you're pregnant!"," Boy, Barney, stop with your abandonment issues. Ted has the right to have a life outside the group. As we all.  No."
Barney," My God, have you ever had the baby! It is just behind me, huh?"," No.  No, silly. One day we all move forward in our lives. It's called growing up."
Barney, You can at least promise to not get pregnant within a year?," That's all you got, f*g?  I can not."
Barney, You can not?, I can not.  You can not?
Barney, No! You can not have children! You want to raise a child in this crazy world.," Okay, again! Bravo, my boy!  The world is pretty cool right now."
Barney," Okay, Lily, I have no choice. If you have a daughter, day, no, the minute she is'... Gong!", The world is pretty cool right now.  Babies.
Barney, I hope Ted is unhappy.," Babies.  Ted, you are a remarkable lyric baritone."
Barney," Okay, you can have a baby, but only under the following conditions: 1-You promise to always love me more than the baby, 2-Once a month, I can use to shake the baby, 3 - It may include a drop baby from the first floor and that saves me; 4-No breastfeeding in front of me. Forget the five-four, get out your breasts when you want."," Thank you, Will Shortz.  And something extraordinary happened."
Barney," Rule number 83. If something out of the baby ends up on my costume, I can touch the breasts of Lily."," I gotta run.  Dude, what's your thing with the breasts of my woman tonight?"
Barney, It is not I who make the rules.," Dude, what's your thing with the breasts of my woman tonight?  Do you really think about all this?"
Barney," Look who thinks he can come here and repeat the group. Well, you can forget. Pity, remake the group! I want to lose anyone yet! We're sorry. You can recite all the poems of assh*le that you want, we never say anything bad on it, I promise.", Deal.  Really? Because there is a poem I would recite... Friendship of Ralph Waldo Emerson. A drop of crimson blood carries more weight than the waves of the sea The world uncertain comes and goes...
Barney, Her ass?, That's it. This is the problem.  Big?
Barney, Once in 30 years.," There will always be a bag. Even if it goes well, it ends one day by spoiling.  When I discover his luggage. I feel it. I do not know what it is, but when I know, it'll be over."
Barney," Please, tell me you repliest not emotional baggage."," When I discover his luggage. I feel it. I do not know what it is, but when I know, it'll be over.  It's a good thing?"
Barney, The emotional baggage is the foundation of American cultural export the most important., It's a good thing?  The p*rn.
Barney," Actually, the p*rn. Only women with major baggage make p*rn.", The p*rn.  Major Baggage.
Barney, On the great grandmother., Certainly not.  I do not like it myself cuddly.
Barney, There is a street where it's normal. One clue: a giant yellow bird lives on., It's normal.  I would love that one bag of Royce or she is nice.
Barney," Gentile? This is the worst baggage. The best: she hates her father, and she believes to be big, but no. Steamy sex at first date, and have brekky, she left. Why are you with me?"," I would love that one bag of Royce or she is nice.  That night, with Royce, I waited to see what would be his luggage."
Barney, That's exactly what happened. It was all good. Even the thing with nunchakus., The code.  I was determined to make this film as far from me as possible. Unfortunately...
Barney, Ted?, Ted?  Barney?
Barney," To be clear, you're saying that you do not have boots red cowboy?"," I'm Jed Mosley. But Royce, missed it... in that cowboy boots red, it's not me.  What..."
Barney, I wanted... People want to know., What...  They are g*n in fact. I promised I'd make pancakes.And... I would keep that promise.
Barney," Come on, darling, kiss him.", All I wanted was some pancakes this week.  Barney did not say kiss. Still not kiss.
Barney, This is outrageous. Thou hast embraced evil!," You must go!  Royce, if you..."
Barney, Kiss it! This film is embraced anyway.," Bluntly, doll.  That happened to me, it was pretty hard. I am not fully recovered."
Barney, Barney here.," I've moved up.  Marshall. So, you're in the office? You're not, I do not know, driving a taxi, with a wig?"
Barney," Yes, I'm in the office. This is the sound of my stapler.This is the sound of my trouilloteuse. And that, the sound of me, ranking the company's directive on sexual harassment. What's new? I gotta run, great leader."," Marshall. So, you're in the office? You're not, I do not know, driving a taxi, with a wig?  Barney's office. It was the fifth double."
Barney," You kiss? Go on, I'm not even there. But just like that, have a baby: big mistake. Now, show me."," If you tell them, they are invited in at the most private and intimate of our lives.  Uncle Ted is here! How you will handle the story of Santa Claus? You should be honest. Damn, I will disguise myself."
Barney," Important? You mean, legendary? Marshall, it's me!"," Sorry. You do not know me. But I wanted to thank you.In fact, you are someone very important in my life.  Oddly, this was not the biggest surprise of the day."
Barney," Yes, I understand. My colleagues are oddly on the fact that I work. I know, I know."," You're the fifth double. How can you be you? I called you, Barney. And we talked about!  To make them believe that I break my ass, when in truth I break some ass, I made a special message. What's new? I gotta run, Grand Chief."
Barney," To make them believe that I break my ass, when in truth I break some ass, I made a special message. What's new? I gotta run, Grand Chief."," Yes, I understand. My colleagues are oddly on the fact that I work. I know, I know.  It was a recording? You called me Big Chief, my nickname special job."
Barney," Come, Grand Chief."," It was a recording? You called me Big Chief, my nickname special job.  Come on. Stops."
Barney," Oh, that. You know how I dream of making love to a woman from each country?", Why are you brown taxi driver?  Sure. You're doing well in the Baltics.
Barney, I thought the fastest way to circumnavigate the world in'0 days. Take a taxi and wait before the United Nations., Sure. You're doing well in the Baltics.  It was the perfect plan. There's a detail I had not expected.
Barney, It was the perfect plan. There's a detail I had not expected., I thought the fastest way to circumnavigate the world in'0 days. Take a taxi and wait before the United Nations.  The girls not want to enter a taxi driver. I worked hard on it.
Barney, The girls not want to enter a taxi driver. I worked hard on it., It was the perfect plan. There's a detail I had not expected.  I think so. I must confess to Lily that the fifth lookalike is false.
Barney, What's the problem?," I think so. I must confess to Lily that the fifth lookalike is false.  Lily decided that once you have seen all the doubles, we try to have children."
Barney, Children!? No! Rule: no children under 45! You never read my blog!? He has improved a lot.," Lily decided that once you have seen all the doubles, we try to have children.  I'm ready to be a father, you know? But Lily needs a sign of the universe. It could take years."
Barney," Sorry, pal. It'll be $ 37.50."," I'm ready to be a father, you know? But Lily needs a sign of the universe. It could take years.  That night, Marshall returned to the news to Lily.(Marshall enters the room where Lily is already there.)"
Barney," They told me, so I've prepared a few. I organize a marriage. Tell me, Billy Idol, it's going to do? More on Billy Idol.If someone wants the real Slim Shady, it's there. This one was good. Robin, why do not you help me?"," The universe has spoken. Marshall Eriksen, make a baby.  First, I get lots of compliments. Then tell her."
Barney, Time out! This is a group decision! You can not go to Chicago before we are all agreed.," Well, there you got wrong.  I think Robin..."
Barney," Stay out of it, Brigitte Nielsen and Dolph Lundgren in Rocky IV! We need Marshall and Lily.", I think Robin...  It was smaller than Barney!
Barney, You kiss?, You forgot what looks like Barney?  Why are you in our room? (Robin's turn to...) Why are you in our room? (Followed by Ted) Why Ellen DeGeneres is in our room?
Barney, Wait a second. Candles... flowers... I guess that Marshall has forgotten to tell you. The fifth lookalike... it was me.," It works!  What? Wait, you were aware? You lied to me?"
Barney, Friends! We forget what is really important here. Ted is blond.," We must control our...  Friends, I'm doing well. Robin has something important to say."
Barney, That's why we're all here. For Robin to deter...," I had a job offer in Chicago.  Actually, I already made my decision. Friends, I must accept."
Barney, Looks like a real movie star!," Thank God, I thought I was the only one!  And besides, it was a big mistake. I will re-stain the hair."
Barney, Not so great that., I told you so.  So I was on the phone with Chicago.
Barney, Excuse me a moment. Estonia Baltic countries would complete!, Excuse me. I heard you come from Estonia. So do I.  And I'm like you clown.
Barney," Calm down. Your husband is here. Trying to hide it, at least."," Yes! You're there! This is fantastic!  The friends, follow me! (They leave) Look! The fifth double."
Barney, This guy looks like me...," The friends, follow me! (They leave) Look! The fifth double.  Guys... Play the game"
Barney, It's like looking in a mirror.," Amazing.  But ultimately, we see only what we want to see, when you're ready to see it."
Barney," I'm sorry. I'll let you work. But first, a riddle: What piece of women's attire most stokes a man's desire?"," Barney, I really... I have to grade these papers.  A sun dress."
Barney," Correct. What lightweight outfit, pink or white, makes the front of my slacks abnormally tight?", A sun dress.  I really have to get this done.
Barney," Of course, of course.", I really have to get this done.  Thank you.
Barney," Sun dress, by the way. Hey! What are you nervous about? Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. What flowing cotton frock..."," Thank you.  Okay, I'll tell you. Just... There's a... There's a girl sitting at the bar. Don't look!"
Barney, I want to see a pretty girl.," Okay, I'll tell you. Just... There's a... There's a girl sitting at the bar. Don't look!  Okay, you can look. Just-just-just be cool for once."
Barney," I'll be cool. Ah, Ted. You got your beer label in a bunch over nothing. Listen to your Uncle Barney. You have no reason to be nervous. None whatsoever. And I'm going to tell you why in one word."," Okay, you can look. Just-just-just be cool for once.  And what's that word?"
Barney, Dibs!, And what's that word?  What... You can't call dibs on a girl I've been sitting here thinking about maybe talking to eventually at some point.
Barney, You never called dibs., What... You can't call dibs on a girl I've been sitting here thinking about maybe talking to eventually at some point.  Dibs were implied.
Barney, Implied dibs?, Dibs were implied.  Yeah.
Barney," Ted, you are spitting on the grave of Sir Walter Dibs, inventor of the dib. It was 1652... The SS Dibs was lost at sea..."," Yeah.  Look, I don't have time for a fake history lesson, so I'll keep this simple. You go over there and talk to that girl, I will see you in court."
Barney, And who's gonna represent you? Dibs on Marshall as my lawyer!," Look, I don't have time for a fake history lesson, so I'll keep this simple. You go over there and talk to that girl, I will see you in court.  Damn it!"
Barney, Where is Marshall anyway?, Damn it!  Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lily had recently decided to take a swing at starting a family. Tonight was their first at-bat.
Barney," Oh, yeah, yeah? Be my guest. Fall in love with her. Get married. Just know this: When I step up to make my toast as your best man..."," You know what? To hell with your dibs. I'm going over there right now and talking to her.  Actually, Marshall would probably be..."
Barney, As your best man...," Actually, Marshall would probably be...  Ladies and Gentlemen... I... had dibs."
Barney, Ladies and Gentlemen... I... had dibs., As your best man...  No!
Barney, What?, No!  Tell me this isn't true.
Barney," Shhh, shh. You're the victim here. We both are. Let's get out of here."," (she slaps him in the face) You know, you've humiliated me!(turning towards Barney)I had no idea. You have to know that.  Or, you know, we could just do it right here."
Barney, We could just do it right here.," Or, you know, we could just do it right here.  Fine. Have at it. Exercise your dibs. She's got her shields up anyway. She's reading a book."
Barney," Yeah. At a bar. That book might as well be called, Are You There, Barney? It's Me, Horny. That is not what shields up looks like. (He points to Robin who is entering the bar, with greasy hair and dirty clothes) That is what shields up looks like."," Fine. Have at it. Exercise your dibs. She's got her shields up anyway. She's reading a book.  Move. God! (She come over Ted and Barney's table) Hey. 'Sup, dudes? Fries?"
Barney," Oh, good God, woman. You're a disgrace."," Move. God! (She come over Ted and Barney's table) Hey. 'Sup, dudes? Fries?  No fries for this guy."
Barney," Robin, seriously, I love you, but it's like you have squiggly cartoon odor lines coming off of you right now."," No fries for this guy.  You know what, Barney? Just cut her some slack, okay? She just went through a breakup."
Barney, With hygiene?," You know what, Barney? Just cut her some slack, okay? She just went through a breakup.  No, with Don. A few months earlier..."
Barney," Oh, you're exquisite. You must let me paint you."," No, we ran out of Cheetos last week. Oh, yeah, it's a Cheeto. Dibs.  Hey Robin, what do you think? The girl sitting at the bar. Shields up?"
Barney, This? What you're doing right now? I'm getting a de-rection.," Mmm, totes, toots. She's here on a date. She brought the book because she got here early, and she also wants to impress the guy she's meeting. Girls like to come across all classy and smart, you know?(She gets a giant hamburger out of a paper bag)  Hey! How'd it go? You pregnant yet?"
Barney, Ohhh," Of course I did. I tell my dad everything. My dad is my best friend.  We have been looking forward to this magical, special night for two weeks now. And, sweetie, during that time, I have been... How do I put this delicately? Saving all my love for you."
Barney, Excuse me?," Okay, Barney. What's this going to cost me?  Your dibs. I want to buy your dibs."
Barney, Two... hundred... and fifty thousand dollars., Your dibs. I want to buy your dibs.  20 bucks.
Barney, But I... Can I go smell her first?, 20 bucks.  No.(He takes $20 out of his wallet)
Barney, Fine.(He takes the money), No.(He takes $20 out of his wallet)  All right. Wish me luck.
Barney, What the hell are you doing?, Good.  That girl she's talking to? I dated her.
Barney," Oh, that sucks! And dibs."," That girl she's talking to? I dated her.  So you went on one date with one of her friends. It's not necessarily a big deal. I mean, did it end on bad terms?"
Barney," Oh, look at you, Robin. You're jealous."," Well, that guy is cheesy, and if you think he's not cheesy, then you're cheesy, too, and now I want something cheesy. Who's feeling nachos?  Jealous?"
Barney," Yeah, jealous, because she's got it, and you've lost it.", Jealous?  I have not lost it.
Barney, You lost it.," I have not lost it.  I still have it. I know exactly where it is, and I can go get it whenever I want."
Barney," Robin, girls are like cartons of milk. Each one has a hotness expiration date, and you've h*t yours. I'm not saying the occasional guy won't still open the fridge, pick you up, give a sniff, shrug and take a sip anyway But it's all downhill from here."," I still have it. I know exactly where it is, and I can go get it whenever I want.  I don't have to take this. But I do have to take this."
Barney," Yeah, she definitely saw you."," Hi, Ted!  Can I see you for a minute... in private?"
Barney," Okay, will do. And dibs."," Yeah. Yeah, sure. I mean, how could that not be fun? If I don't come back, tell my mom I love her.  Barney, am I crazy? Marshall talks to his dad way too much, right?"
Barney," Oh, you don't want my opinion on that."," Barney, am I crazy? Marshall talks to his dad way too much, right?  Why not?"
Barney," If I had my dad's number, I would never not be on the phone with him.", Why not?  That was really...
Barney," Whoa, a hottie with a body! Boing...!", That was really...  Brief.
Barney," No. Lily, look.(looking at Robin standing at the bar)You saucy little minx. You sundressed up.", Brief.  Hi.
Barney," Robin, you do look super hot."," 14 seconds! 14 seconds, and already some dingdong is stepping up, thinking he can get some of this broke off. I... still... got... it. All right, buddy, you proved my point. Now scram. Nice belt, by the way.  Oh, do I?"
Barney," Yeah, you do."," Oh, do I?  Thanks."
Barney," Dude, you are so in. That is so awesome. A high five doesn't even cut it. High six!"," Her words exactly.  She didn't see us high-six, did she?"
Barney, No. Good. That was pretty lame.," She didn't see us high-six, did she?  Yeah, let's never do that again."
Barney," So, this chick and I are going at it behind the Central Park Zoo. The Bonobo chimps start giving us a standing O, and just when I'm about to give her the same thing... What up?... I... I can't. I just... I can't. Guys, I know you count the minutes until you can escape from your humdrum lives by hearing how awesome mine is, and I love doing that for you, but I just can't tonight."," So, this chick and I are going at it behind the Central Park Zoo.

Barney, I don't want to talk about it.," What's wrong?  Okay. Hey, you guys see Deadliest Catch last night?"
Barney," All right, I'll tell you! My mother is selling the house I grew up in. All of my childhood memories gone, just like that!"," Did I ever! Deadliest Catch ever!  That sucks. I've been there, buddy."
Barney," Anyway, I need you guys to come out to Staten Island on Saturday and help box everything up."," With her new hippie husband, Clint. The comfort of home is a little ruined when someone turns your old room into what I'm pretty sure is a Tantric sex temple. With all the bamboo, pot smoke and '60s music, it's like my old G.I. Joes are frozen in some weird Vietnam flashback.  You expect us to spend a whole day packing up your mom's house?"
Barney, Of course not. It's a two-day job., You expect us to spend a whole day packing up your mom's house?  Pass.
Barney," You guys are adorable. You seriously believe that I, Barney Stinson, can't talk you into this? I got the Queen to give me a fist bump.", Unsubscribe.  No one believes that story.
Barney," Whoa, Ted, that thing you're packing is way too big to fit in that box."," So there we were helping Barney pack up his childhood home.  Yeah, that's what your mom said."
Barney, How dare you!," Yeah, that's what your mom said.  No, she actually said that."
Barney, Bro!, James!  How you doing?
Barney, Mom. Stop.," Look at my two sons. So big and strong and handsome.  And how is my delicious little grandson? Oh, did he get the clothes I sent him?"
Barney, Tuesday at work. Some of the senior partners are really getting up there.," Check it. Huh? How cute is that, right? When was the last time you saw a diaper poking out of a Dolce and Gabana suit?  So, Ted, yesterday at work, I totally talked you up to that super-hot makeup girl, Liz."
Barney," I loved Pee Wee basketball. Well, until they kicked me off the team... I was so awesome, the coach asked me to quit because it wasn't fair to the other kids."," Oh, it gives us a rare insight into the makings of Barney Stinson. Like, look at this. Who was a cute little basketball player before he became the biggest pervert in the world?  I was so awesome, the coach asked me to quit because it wasn't fair to the other kids."
Barney," I was so awesome, the coach asked me to quit because it wasn't fair to the other kids."," I loved Pee Wee basketball. Well, until they kicked me off the team... I was so awesome, the coach asked me to quit because it wasn't fair to the other kids.  That sounds plausible."
Barney," Hey. It's true. Tell him, James."," That sounds plausible.  Oh, yeah, he had, like, a four-foot vertical leap. He would h*t it from the outside, h*t it from the inside... He sucked. Coach cut him from the team, and Mom fed him that story so he'd feel better."
Barney," Oh, my God! Look at this. My letter from the Postmaster General. I still can't believe he took the time to write this..."," Oh, yeah, he had, like, a four-foot vertical leap. He would h*t it from the outside, h*t it from the inside... He sucked. Coach cut him from the team, and Mom fed him that story so he'd feel better.  Dear Barney... I sincerely apologize about losing all the invitations you sent out to your eighth birthday party. That's why none of your classmates showed up. Not because you threw up when they turned the lights off at the Planetarium. No one even noticed that. Also, Janey Masterson's mother is a whore, and with gin on her breath at 10:00 in the morning, she's got some nerve kicking us out of the carpool. Love, Postmaster General."

Barney, Thank you.," Dear Barney... I sincerely apologize about losing all the invitations you sent out to your eighth birthday party. That's why none of your classmates showed up.

Also, Janey Masterson's mother is a whore, and with gin on her breath at 10:00 in the morning, she's got some nerve kicking us out of the carpool. Love, Postmaster General.  Does your mom make stuff like that up a lot?"
Barney, Mom? Who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine?," Constantly. I mean, she put more effort into some lies than others.  Oh, I don't know... That guy."
Barney, Careful! Michael Jackson sent me this glove for my tenth...," No. No, no. I heard Flip Wilson, Bill Cosby, James Earl Jones, Meadowlark Lemon... The list goes on. I still can't get a straight answer about who my real dad is. And Barney's no help. He still believes every lie that my mom told us growing up. Not me. I caught on early.  Damn. Loretta really lied a lot to her kids."
Barney, Ah... Valentines. The second base of third grade. I always got a Valentine from every single girl in my class.," I'm not lying to our kids.  Funny how all these girls have the exact same handwriting as the Postmaster General, Mom, and... home run king, Frank Aaron."
Barney," Yeah, school girls... The more they ignore you, pretend to hate your guts, lock you in the coatroom over winter break, the more they secretly like you. This isn't... Who's Sam Gibbs?"," Funny how all these girls have the exact same handwriting as the Postmaster General, Mom, and... home run king, Frank Aaron.  No idea. Why?"
Barney, Mom addressed this and never sent it., No idea. Why?  What's in it?
Barney," Hey. (laughs) It's a picture of you and me when we were little kids. On the back, Mom wrote... Your son."," What's in it?  Okay, everyone, lunch is ready. Who wants Sloppy Joes?"
Barney," I know. Forgetting to send the photo. That poor sculptor had to work from memory. Those statues probably look nothing like us. Damn it, Mom!Back in the bedroom"," Can you believe her?  So, Ted? You were worried that I oversold you to Liz. Well, I fixed it."
Barney," Well, he's not my dad. My dad's Bob Barker."," Listen to me. There is no Yourson, North Dakota. Mom... And Sam Gibbs wasn't the mayor. He might be one of our fathers.  Barney! You... You've got to stop living in these fairy tales that Mom told us! Bob Barker is not your father. Sam Gibbs might be, but Bob Barker is absolutely, unequivocally not your father."
Barney," So we're doing this? We're really going to go disturb the peaceful Long Island retirement of the former mayor of Yourson, North Dakota on a Sunday afternoon? Real classy, James. Real classy."," This address isn't too far. Are you coming with me, or not?  You're just too scared to face the truth. You're living in a dream world."
Barney, Really rich?," No, they won't. They're going to think... Wait. Everyone?  You ready for this?"
Barney," For what? I don't know who lives here, but it's not my dad. Wait. Wait. Please, stop. Just... just give me a second, okay?", You ready for this?  I thought you said that he... Stop.
Barney," Come on. I know Bob Barker's not really... you know. I'm not crazy. I just... I needed that. I know it may sound stupid, but I didn't always feel so great about myself growing up, and so having a celebrity dad made me feel special. But you're right, James. It's time to let go of the fantasies. It's time to grow up.", I thought you said that he... Stop.  Come here.
Barney," Papa! Look at us!nIt's like three of the same guy. Oh, my God, this explains why I was always so awesome at basketball. Guys, I'm black! Sorry. African-American. No. I'm allowed to say either. I got to go get my camera!"," Yeah, but you know what? He took a big step today...  That is my younger brother, Barney. He just thought he'd meet his real dad today, and clearly, he's not taking it so well."
Barney," Here, Ted. Capture the moment!"," Guys, Barney's losing his childhood home, he finally admitted Bob Barker's not his dad, and then he watched James meet his real father. It's just a lot to go through in one afternoon. Can't we just let the guy be black for a day?  I think you'd need Salvador Dali to capture this particular moment, but I'll give it a whirl."
Barney," Man... I thought I was a light-skinned Caucasian, but in truth, I'm a really light-skinned African-American. Man, try to hail a cab in Manhattan. Am I right? Nope, no one's stopping for this. These guys don't understand what I'm talking about."," I think you'd need Salvador Dali to capture this particular moment, but I'll give it a whirl.  During that afternoon, Sam and James began to discover how much they had in common."
Barney," Dad, look how fast I can run!"," She does. It's Robert De Niro, but, like, super buff, like in Cape Fear.  He's actually a really sweet guy, and he's great with my son."
Barney," Dad, you're not looking!"," He's beautiful.  Eventually, the strangest afternoon of our lives wound to a close, and we headed back to Staten Island, where Barney and his mom had a long overdue heart-to-heart."
Barney," Me first. Mom, there's something that I need to ask you, and I... I want you to be honest with me. Why do white people like Carrot Top?"," Barney? I need to talk to you.  Listen... I always wanted to be enough for you boys. I think that's why it always hurt whenever you asked about your dads, because I was always trying so hard to be both parents for you. But I was being selfish. You deserve the truth. So here it is. Sam is not your father."
Barney, Are you sure?," Listen... I always wanted to be enough for you boys. I think that's why it always hurt whenever you asked about your dads, because I was always trying so hard to be both parents for you. But I was being selfish. You deserve the truth. So here it is. Sam is not your father.  Yes. He's black, dear. But if you want, I can tell you who your father really is."
Barney," What'd Coach say, Ma?"," I'm sorry, but your son can't be on the team. He's terrible.  He said you're simply too good to be on the team. It's not fair to the other boys. But that's okay. We can just play together in the backyard."
Barney, Why didn't anyone come?," He said you're simply too good to be on the team. It's not fair to the other boys. But that's okay. We can just play together in the backyard.  Oh, you know what, dear? Apparently, there was a mix-up with the mail. I just got this letter from the Postmaster General. Dear Barney, I sincerely apologize for losing all the invitations you sent out to your eighth birthday party."
Barney," It's okay, Mom. I don't need it.", Barney.  But it's your father.
Barney, I already have a father. And his name... is Loretta.," But it's your father.  Kids, your uncle Barney grew up without a dad. And it always made him feel incomplete. But as he hugged Loretta, surrounded by the boxes into his happy childhood, he realized he had one hell of a mom."
Barney, Wait. Dad! James! Where are you going? That's the best part. Can we go camping?," Kids, your uncle Barney grew up without a dad. And it always made him feel incomplete. But as he hugged Loretta, surrounded by the boxes into his happy childhood, he realized he had one hell of a mom."
Barney," Ted, look across the bar. Three chicks: one hot, one kind of hot and one who I'm assuming is really funny. We ride! What's wrong?"," But first, let's back up a few days.  I don't know. Got a burger coming."
Barney," Yeah, I'm not going to go through that again."," Bro, I told you, if you ever need a wingman, I'm your guy.  Hi. Barney Stinson."
Barney, Hi. Barney Stinson.," Yeah, I'm not going to go through that again.  And I'm Marshall, Barney's wingman."
Barney, Thank you for your time.," And I'm Marshall, Barney's wingman.  Fine. I'll have a three-way with hot and kind of hot while Giggles works the camera. I ride!"
Barney, Fine. I'll have a three-way with hot and kind of hot while Giggles works the camera. I ride!," Thank you for your time.  So, get this: Last night, I was watching TV, and it turns out, some random satellite channel picks up a certain local Chicago newscast."
Barney," Look, I didn't get sh*t down. Trust me, I'll get the yes. Barney Stinson always gets the yes. This is all part of the plan. After initial contact, I'm now in the ignoring phase."," Back already. How was flying solo? And by solo, I mean so low that you got sh*t down.  Barney, why can't you just take a girl out to dinner like a normal person?"
Barney," Golden rule: I do not buy dinner to get the yes. Dinner's a very intimate activity. It requires a level of connection and eye contact that sex just doesn't. Call me old-fashioned, but I need to have sex with a girl at least three times before I'll even consider having dinner with her."," Barney, why can't you just take a girl out to dinner like a normal person?  The next day, at the university, I had a surprise visitor."
Barney," No, you pent-up old perv. I brought you a present. Recognize this?"," What are you doing here? Oh, God! You're dating one of my students. It's Rachel, isn't it? Barney, I know she wears provocative sweaters, but she's'! Now I'm gonna have to hear all about it, right? Go on, tell me every detail.  It's my building."
Barney," Do you remember how awesome it was to be co-workers... Nay, bro-workers?"," Kids, you may remember that, a few years earlier, I was chosen to design the new Manhattan headquarters for Goliath National Bank. It was the opportunity every architect dreams about. And when the project was ultimately scrapped... it broke my heart.  Wait a minute. Y-You don't mean..."
Barney," Ted Mosby, it's back on. We're gonna build your building."," Wait a minute. Y-You don't mean...  This is awesome... You're designing our new headquarters. Now, there will be voices that tell you a hockey rink on the roof is unfeasible. You've got to shut those voices out."
Barney, Of course not.," I can't take the job, Barney. I'm done with that life. No hard feelings?  All right."
Barney, I need another drink.," I'm telling you, no architect would ever design a giant exposed vent right over a Death Star's core reactor. That's Space Architecture 101. It had to be the contractor. Barney, back me up. Barney. Dude, this is important.  Marshall, you want anything?"
Barney, Please. I'll get the yes. Barney Stinson always gets the yes.," So, you still think Ted's gonna take the job?  Am I wrong or is that exactly what Barney says when he's putting the moves on a girl?"
Barney," Chrissy, I love your glasses."," Okay, well, think about it. We've seen his moves countless times. What does he do after he's done ignoring a girl?  Really?"
Barney, They totally pull focus up from that whole chin situation you got going on. To Chrissy., Really?  The backhanded compliment to lower her self-esteem... a proven winner.
Barney," Ted, I admire your loyalty. You've had that hairstyle forever. You don't care that it's out of fashion or that it's been co-opted by the lesbian community. You stick with it. To Ted."," But Barney hasn't done...  Hey, Lily!"
Barney," Man, every time I take out my business card and women see the GNB logo, they throw themselves at me. I miss the chase. It sucks! (...) Man, the courtside Knicks seats that are available to all upper level GNB employees are too close to the action. I keep getting sweat on my suit. It sucks! (...) Man, GNB's benefits package is so comprehensive it gives me the freedom to see any doctor I want. It sucks!", Which moves are we talking about? Did he do the thing where he brags on himself in the form of a complaint?  He did.
Barney," So, Ted, would you like to split some jalapeno poppers?", And the intense eye contact thing?  Okay. Yep.
Barney, That is so true., You know why jalapeno poppers are so good? It's the cream cheese.  Yeah... Cream cheese has a mild flav-flavor so it... it balances out the spiciness of the jal... the spiciness of the... Dude!
Barney," Oh, that reminds me. I got you a little airplane. It represents the spirit of adventure. Do you like it, Ted? Do you?"," Barney, I gotta tell you something.  Stop it. Stop looking at me like I'm the only person in the world who matters. I'm not designing the GNB Tower."
Barney," Yeah, I know. You turned it down. We hired someone else."," Stop it. Stop looking at me like I'm the only person in the world who matters. I'm not designing the GNB Tower.  Can you believe it? He's resorting to the oldest move in the book. The classic, pretend to take the offer off the table so I'll want it more. It's so obvious, right? As if that's going to make me be like, Oh, God, I never should have said no."
Barney," What? Ted, it's too late."," Okay, I'll do it!  I'll design it for half of what you're paying the other architect. And you know I will do stuff they would never do. Lobby stuff."
Barney," Wow, half? Ted, on behalf of Goliath National Bank..."," I'll design it for half of what you're paying the other architect. And you know I will do stuff they would never do. Lobby stuff.  Okay, it's a move."
Barney, Dude!," What?  There is no other architect. I'm sorry, I'm sorry I lied. I was being Barney's wingman, and I never get to be the wingman."
Barney, You're the world's worst wingman. You know what? I'm out of here., You guys lied to me?  I can do better. Take me back. You son of a bitch!
Barney, We only lied to you to make you realize that you want this job.," Look, I can't do business with people who lie to me.  No, I don't. I mean, I know I said I did, but that's only because I fell for the same creepy, pickup artist voodoo of yours that countless women..."
Barney,236," No, I don't. I mean, I know I said I did, but that's only because I fell for the same creepy, pickup artist voodoo of yours that countless women... ...before me fell for. Wow, respect."
Barney," Come on, Ted! This is your dream."," No... Ted... you want to do this, okay? You're just scared of getting hurt again. But you can't let fear steal your funk. That is good. There is a song in there. Excuse me.  No, it's not. Not anymore. And you know what? Letting go of that dream was the best decision I ever made. You guys actually think I have some lingering itch to be an architect? Work 20 hours a day and weekends? To get ulcers and pull my hair out and worry and doubt myself and then at the end of it all, have the rug pulled out from under me? I love being a professor, okay? All that stupid crap they tell you about how fulfilling teaching is? It's all true. I'm happy, and I'm not letting go of that. My answer's no."
Barney," Yeah, Ted. Why aren't you in class? You son of a bitch. I'll call Marshall. We'll draw up the contract.", Why aren't you in class?  Not so fast. I'm not that easy.
Barney, I cannot stop staring at that girl's face., I cannot stop staring at that girl's face.  Face. Huh. That's your weirdest nickname for boobs yet.
Barney," No, Ted, I'm really looking at her face.", Face. Huh. That's your weirdest nickname for boobs yet.  Aw... That's actually really sweet.
Barney," Puffy cheeks, smudged mascara, slightly red nose... That girl was just crying. She's so sad and defenseless. Anyone have a condom?"," Aw... That's actually really sweet.  Oh! Oh, God! No, no, no!"
Barney," Okay, time's up. What are we talking about?"," By the end of this day, Robin would have done all of those things.  Woody Allen is eating at Gregor's, and Robin thinks that we should go see him."
Barney, Why would I do that? I'll see him at poker on Tuesday.," Woody Allen is eating at Gregor's, and Robin thinks that we should go see him.  Oh, come on, if we jump in a cab, we'll be there in 15 minutes."
Barney," The bus? Every time I take the bus, there is one crazy person no one wants to sit near. That's why I have never taken the bus. Plus... I can run faster than a bus."," Well, the bus runs more often on weekends. Take the M-7 to the M-5.  Dude, that's, like, seven miles. You can't do that. You can't b*at the bus!"
Barney," You're all wrong... I got a way to get there so fast, I could b*at all of you, even if I sat down and ordered a big, juicy steak first."," Machines are overrated, and someone needs to take them down a peg.  How?"
Barney," Medium rare. But that's not important right now. Look, I know the city better than any of you guys, okay?"," How?  Oh, my God!"
Barney," Oh, wow!"," Oh, my God!  All right, all right, hold on, hold on! Let's just forget about it. Who cares? I mean, there's no way to find out who's right anyway. First person there wins!(Everyone stand up et run outside)Doesn't matter how you get there!"
Barney, (to the sad girl at the bar)Stay sad! I'll be back!," All right, all right, hold on, hold on! Let's just forget about it. Who cares? I mean, there's no way to find out who's right anyway. First person there wins!(Everyone stand up et run outside)Doesn't matter how you get there!  Hi. Can I see a menu, please? No rush."
Barney," Hi. Can I see a menu, please? No rush."," (to the sad girl at the bar)Stay sad! I'll be back!  Kids, I should tell you, Lily really needed a win that day."
Barney, Hey! Come on! Elizabeth!, That's the gray one. Did you know that in'...  Somebody call an ambulance!
Barney," Downtown hospital, please. It's right by Gregor's Steakhouse. Take the FDR, and maybe crank up some smooth jazz.","(jumping onto the cab)This is my cab...!  Uh, we're required by law to take you to the nearest hospital, which is St. Luke's-Roosevelt. Uptown."
Barney," Oh, no.(He makes a phone call)It's Barney. Help me."," Uh, we're required by law to take you to the nearest hospital, which is St. Luke's-Roosevelt. Uptown.  Robin also needed a win that day."
Barney," Ranjit, take me to Gregor's.", Hello.  Taking you to Gregor's.
Barney," Hey, Ranjit, pull over."," Well, you're in luck. See that gothic church over there? Those corinthian columns were designed by Giuseppe Pegatto in'96.(the woman stands up to find another place)  Pulling over."
Barney," Hey, toots! How about a ride? Oh. Hey, Robin, it's you.", Pulling over.  * Hyah! Move along. Hyah! Move along. Hyah! *
Barney, I'm sorry. I never apologize. And why would I?," So, is this ride your way of apologizing for this morning?  Are you kidding me?"
Barney, Sure. Stand a little more this way. I'm scouting some talent. Pretend we're talking about something important.," Hey, Barney, can I talk to you?  Oh, well, this... This is something important. Um, I'm having a... A really rough time at work. You know, the whole Becky thing..."
Barney," Oh, you know what? That's just getting distracting. Um, say carrots and peas. Carrots and peas. Guys, I can't stop staring at that girl's face."," Oh, well, this... This is something important. Um, I'm having a... A really rough time at work. You know, the whole Becky thing...  What, you really had something to talk about?"
Barney," What, you really had something to talk about?"," Oh, you know what? That's just getting distracting. Um, say carrots and peas. Carrots and peas. Guys, I can't stop staring at that girl's face.  Yes. Look, I've spent the last,six years in this city, focusing on my career, all for nothing. Some lady almost got me k*lled. Maury Povich stole my cab. I swear, this city is starting to reject me like a bad organ transplant. You know, everyone keeps saying that I'm not a real New Yorker. Well, maybe I should just stop trying."
Barney," Robin, I had no idea."," Yes. Look, I've spent the last,six years in this city, focusing on my career, all for nothing. Some lady almost got me k*lled. Maury Povich stole my cab. I swear, this city is starting to reject me like a bad organ transplant. You know, everyone keeps saying that I'm not a real New Yorker. Well, maybe I should just stop trying.  No, it's my fault for thinking that you might care. Ranjit, stop the car."
Barney," No, don't stop the car.", Stopping the car.  Not stopping the car.
Barney," Look, you... Wait, wait... Robin, hold on. If you want to talk, I'm right here.", Seriously stopping the car.  Carrots and peas.
Barney, Don't... You..., Carrots and peas.  I'll crank up the smooth jazz.
Barney, Faster. Mush! Mush! I need this win. I need this win.," Oh, God. Oh, bite me!  And f*ring half my department freed up the money to double my own salary. And this chick from Boston was wicked hot in bed last night, and I'm getting more muscular, even though I've stopped working out, and I've got this amazing poker group."
Barney," And f*ring half my department freed up the money to double my own salary. And this chick from Boston was wicked hot in bed last night, and I'm getting more muscular, even though I've stopped working out, and I've got this amazing poker group."," Faster. Mush! Mush! I need this win. I need this win.  Actually, Barney did not need a win."
Barney," And I smell incredible. Smell me. Just, seriously, smell me."," Actually, Barney did not need a win. He did smell incredible."
Barney, Stop! Too slow. Switch.,He did smell incredible.  Sweetie? Are you okay?
Barney, Who cares?, Where are Marshall and lily?  I won? I won!
Barney, No!, I won? I won!  I can't believe I won!
Barney, How did that even happen?, I can't believe I won!  Here's how it happened.
Barney, No!," I won!  So I said, the cab, of course"
Barney," Yeah. Check it. I just drove a pedicab 26 blocks, and I still smell incredible. Smell me.", I know what you did back there.  I'm not gonna... Not gonna...
Barney, Smell me., I'm not gonna... Not gonna...  He did smell incredible.
Barney, Sick. Yeah. Dude. Working together is gonna be legen... Wait for it. I'll send you an inter-office memo with the rest 'cause we freakin' work together!," I love your idea about a giant rooftop ring of f*re you can jump through with a motorcycle, but I tweaked it slightly and... This is still super bad-ass. It's now a patio garden where you can bring a nice bag lunch.  Everything was going great. That is, right up until Barney said..."
Barney," Oh, big news. The board finally settled on a site for the building."," Everything was going great. That is, right up until Barney said...  It was the site of The Arcadian, one of New York's grandest old hotels. In its heyday, it was the New York home to kings and queens. But lately... mostly just queens."
Barney, Sure. What's up?," Barney, we have to talk.  Excuse me, Mr. Stinson."
Barney," Not now, Trish!"," Excuse me, Mr. Stinson.  But there's an urgent memo for Mr. Mosby."
Barney, But there's an urgent memo for Mr. Mosby.," Not now, Trish!  Dary."
Barney," Legendary! So, what's on your mind?", Dary.  I can't design the building.
Barney, You're kidding me.," Just don't!  I'm sorry. I can't do this if it means tearing down The Arcadian. It's an architectural landmark. Plus, people live there. How does GNB plan to get hundreds of residents to just up and leave?"
Barney, Snakes.," I'm sorry. I can't do this if it means tearing down The Arcadian. It's an architectural landmark. Plus, people live there. How does GNB plan to get hundreds of residents to just up and leave?  Did you just say snakes?"
Barney," I don't recall saying snakes. Ted, I know you love crappy old stuff no one cares about. But I'm gonna give you four words to live by: New is always better.", Did you just say snakes?  New is always better?
Barney, You know who's a million times hotter than the hottest girl I've ever slept with? Her okay-looking friend I haven't seen naked. Why? Because new is always better., New is always better?  Mm-hmm? And this theory applies to everything?
Barney, Everything.," Mm-hmm? And this theory applies to everything?  So, those new Star Wars movies... Those are better than the old ones?"
Barney, Yeah. The first three barely mention the intricacies of intergalactic trade law.," So, those new Star Wars movies... Those are better than the old ones?  And when you're at a g*n n' Roses concert, you're like, Yeah, yeah, Paradise City, whatever. When are they gonna rock me some Chinese Democracy?"
Barney," Axl's really matured as a songwriter, Ted."," And when you're at a g*n n' Roses concert, you're like, Yeah, yeah, Paradise City, whatever. When are they gonna rock me some Chinese Democracy?  Wendy! I'd like to buy my friend a drink. What's your oldest Scotch?"
Barney," A glass of the J-Jumbo Jim's Grape Scotch sounds lovely. Lots of ice. New is always better, Ted! That's a rule. Just like bigger is always better!"," Your call, buddy.  Pff. That's not true. Uh, sometimes smaller is better. Hey, look how big my cell phone is! You don't hear people say that. No. You want something compact and efficient that fits comfortably in your pocket, and I think Max is just a great guy."
Barney, How can you speak of such things?, Max has a small penis.  Girls talk about everything.
Barney, How can you speak of such things?," Length, resemblance to a historical figure, such as Winston Churchill... Yes, that's one of you. Girth, grooming...  You're kidding. Barney, every time I mention a woman you don't know, the first thing you say is, Boobs? Not the complete sentence, Does she have big boobs? Which also would not be great. Just: Boobs?"
Barney, I do not do that.," You're kidding. Barney, every time I mention a woman you don't know, the first thing you say is, Boobs? Not the complete sentence, Does she have big boobs? Which also would not be great. Just: Boobs?  My friend Lori from work..."
Barney, Boobs? Damn it. But... seriously. Boobs?," My friend Lori from work...  So why is it okay for guys to talk about boobs, but the moment we bring up a topic like Max's small penis... I'm gonna pretend this conversation never happened."
Barney," Speaking of disappointing weenies... Ted, tell them what you told me.", Impossible. Max's penis is stuck in my brain like a splinter. Like a splinter-sized splinter.  I want to ask the board at GNB to move the site for the new headquarters so we don't have to tear down a classic old building.
Barney," I still don't get this. Why, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, do you want to ruin... Wait a minute. Who's the girl?", I want to ask the board at GNB to move the site for the new headquarters so we don't have to tear down a classic old building.  Duh. Of course there's a girl.
Barney, Boobs?," What? I... There's no g-girl. Why would you even... Her name is Zoey.  Beautiful building, right?"
Barney, Whose dream?, She's an architecture nerd! A hot architecture nerd! That's the dream!  We wound up talking for hours.
Barney," Oh, Ted, that's so romantic. I want to fill a pillowcase with d*ad batteries and b*at you with it."," That's sweet. It would be sweeter if you hadn't thought I was a tr*nny before, but it's still sweet.  Hey, Ted, can I ask you something"
Barney, And you said...?, Will you sign this petition? Save The Arcadian We are gonna stop the bastards at Goliath National Bank from demolishing it. Will you support us?  Where do I sign?
Barney," Hmm. Grape scotch. Not bad. Ted, you only think The Arcadian needs to be saved because some pretty girl thinks that. And seriously... Boobs?", Where do I sign?  This isn't about the girl. It's about the building.
Barney," And what did this Zoey say when she found out that you're the one tearing down her beloved Arcadian? That you, Ted Mosby, are the Architect Of Destruction?", This isn't about the girl. It's about the building.  Whoa! Sweet wrestling name alert.
Barney, This whole Arcadian thing is classic Mosby. Changing your personality to fit some girl., What? I panicked!  I don't do that.
Barney, Asian girls love them some Jews., Aww! Come on! Come on! We all change a little for whoever we're into. Barney pretended to be a rabbi to get laid.  And Marshall never would've listened to The Indigo Girls if it weren't for Lily.
Barney," No. Technically, they were eggs."," The point is, you weren't pretending to like the Indigo Girls for the other person. You realized you liked them because of the other person. Just like me, Zoey and The Arcadian. Did GNB really put snakes in The Arcadian?  Did you just say eggs?"
Barney, I don't recall saying eggs.The restaurant," Did you just say eggs?  So I walk into my boss's office and suddenly I realize, Holy crap, I'm about to quit"
Barney," Ted, this woman is an anarchist, a sociopath, a lunatic, and for the love of God, boobs?!"," Ted, I will find the bastards at GNB responsible for this, and I promise you, I will take them down.  Solid C-cup, perky bounce."
Barney, Momentary grudging respect.," Solid C-cup, perky bounce.  Zoey does what she believes is right, and I want to do the same thing. We have to find a new site for this building."
Barney," Ted, that is never gonna happen."," Zoey does what she believes is right, and I want to do the same thing. We have to find a new site for this building.  Well, I can't tear down The Arcadian. I'm sorry, but I'm off the project."
Barney, Simple. I rented the chair. The bunny was here already. That was lucky. I waited to do the dramatic swivel until I heard your key enter the door.," How the hell could you do that?  The billboard, Barney."
Barney," I had to. Now that you have no sh*t with the girl, you'll realize you never cared about the building, and everything can go back to normal."," The billboard, Barney.  You're wrong. I do care. And I'm still quitting."
Barney," Don't you get it, Ted? We're tearing down The Arcadian either way. It's a stupid old piece-of-crap, run-down, snake-infested dump!"," You're wrong. I do care. And I'm still quitting.  Okay, are there or aren't there snakes?!"
Barney, Who mentioned snakes?! And stop shouting! You're scaring Cottontail.," Okay, are there or aren't there snakes?!  You named the rabbit?"
Barney," You took longer to get here than I thought, we bonded, I'm keeping her. The point is, you now have a chance to design your own building. Dude, you can do whatever you want with it.", You named the rabbit?  You're right. You're right. I can design it however I want.
Barney, So you're back in?, You're right. You're right. I can design it however I want.  Yeah.
Barney, You want the long version or the short version?," You, too? Can somebody please explain to me why the little girl act works on men?  Short version."
Barney, Short version. Who's your daddy?," Short version.  You know, when you think about that, that phrase is really creepy."
Barney, Challenge accepted.," Exactly. And it's not like the opposite would work. There's no way a guy could pick up a girl, going around talking like a little boy.  No."
Barney," I, Barney Stinson, will pick up a girl whilst talking like a little boy.", No.  Okay. Here's my list of baby names.
Barney," Oh, Esther gets naked. But she doesn't dance."," Oh. Oh. Hey, Barney. That prime rib was surprisingly good, but it's 10:30 in the morning. I don't need to see a lady get naked and dance.  Then what does she do? Sweet mother nature!"
Barney, That was my card!," Then what does she do? Sweet mother nature!  Gentlemen, gentlemen. Give it up for Esther!"
Barney,"Hey, bro. Thanks for making such a hottie. (weak laughter) Who's your daddy?","Papa, I want you to meet my new boyfriend. You are, 'cause of all the sex we have."
Barney, I'm dying out here. Talking like a little boy is not working with the ladies.," (scoffing) Yeah, I slept.  (in childlike voice)Wow, lady. You got some tig ol' bitties! Gosh! Your body's a perfect... this many.(To another girl)Hi. Do you want to wrestle with our special bathing suit places? Come on!"
Barney," (in childlike voice)Wow, lady. You got some tig ol' bitties! Gosh! Your body's a perfect... this many.(To another girl)Hi. Do you want to wrestle with our special bathing suit places? Come on!"," I'm dying out here. Talking like a little boy is not working with the ladies.  Mm, I just need two seconds, baby."
Barney,"(little boy voice)Hey, want to have a three-way with me and my imaginary friend? His name's Otis. Hey, hey, want to come to my house and play telephone? I got the string; you got the cans. (giggles) I wet myself! Will you change me? Can't blame her on that one. Guys... I have some terrible, terrible news. I, Barney Stinson, can't pick up a girl whilst talking like a little boy. Challenge forfeited."," Gentlemen, gentlemen, on the main stage, throwing her life away, give it up for Marshall's daughter!  Yeah, we don't care about this..."
Barney,(whispers)I'm sorry.," No one challenged you, so it wasn't really a challenge.  Hey, Gerard, what's with that shirt? Nobody could pick up a chick wearing that thing."
Barney, Challenge accept...," Hey, Gerard, what's with that shirt? Nobody could pick up a chick wearing that thing.  Wow, I'm glad that's over. It was creepy watching Barney talk like a little kid."
Barney, Hey.," Hey.  Hey. Um, when we were dating, did... did I make you feel needed?"
Barney," No, I didn't feel like you needed me at all."," Hey. Um, when we were dating, did... did I make you feel needed?  That's what I thought. Uh, I'm sorry."
Barney," Wait, where are you... That's a compliment. You are the least needy woman I've ever met-- that's awesome. I mean, no guy's gonna say Who's your daddy? to Robin Scherbatsky. You're your own daddy. And mommy. And weird survivalist uncle who lives in a cabin with a g*n blaming stuff on the government. And that is what makes you the most... amazing, strong... independent woman I've ever banged."," That's what I thought. Uh, I'm sorry.  Thanks, Barney. You know, um... there's something that I wanted to ask you, and I don't really know how to say it so... here goes. Who's the crazy chick in the apron?"
Barney," (baby voice): Uh-oh, I'm in twubble.",(baby voice) Someone naughty left his toys on the floor and needs to be spanked on his tushy-tush.  You did it? How?
Barney," Last night, after admitting defeat, I just let myself go."," You did it? How?  Mmm, that looks so good. Can I have some?"
Barney, No! It's my ice cream; you can't have any.," Mmm, that looks so good. Can I have some? (baby voice) Someone needs to teach you how to share. Who's your mommy?"
Barney," Challenge completed!(chuckles)Now, uh, can you get this freak out of here? I'm really scared.",(baby voice) Someone needs to teach you how to share. Who's your mommy?  I got this.
Barney," Man, I love the office Halloween party. It is so much sluttier than the office Christmas party. Though not as freaky as the office President's Day Rave. Or the office Tu B'Shvat Pajama Jammy-Jam."," It's not her nose that's in my ass, Lily, it's her heart. My class loves me; I-I'm really making an impression on those guys. I'd like to make impression on those guys.  Hey, guys."
Barney, I wouldn't consider any part of that bragging.," Oh, no, thank you. I brew my own. At the risk of bragging, my Hazelnut Pilsner won fourth prize at the Weehawken Retirement Home Clam Bake and Wheelchair Maintenance Picnic.  Hey, it just occurred to me, is your friend, what's her name? Garbin, Flabin..."
Barney, (shudders) Looks like that bee got busy.," Look at them heading home after their dirty, filthy hookups.  Looks like that French maid didn't turn down somebody's bed."
Barney, That's a line.," Come on, Marshall.  No, it's because of the..."
Barney, Does it get any better than this?," We get it.  Uh, yes. (Robin arrives)Yes, it does."
Barney, There she is Florence Night-In-Bed-With-A-Stranger.,"  So, who's the lucky patient?"
Barney, Please tell me you are hooking up with one of your co-anchors again. (laughing)," My co-anchor's a woman.  Robin had always believed that the key to success was intelligence, hard work and professionalism. Her new co-anchor Becky had a different philosophy."
Barney, I care about our precious Earth.," What makes Goliath National Bank different from other big banks? Here at GNB, we care.  I care about old people."
Barney, All you have to do is say I care about making dreams come true.," Yeah. Okay, get that camera out of my face before I flip you like a cheese omelet.  First of all, that line makes me sound like a hooker and saying it makes me feel like a hooker, so."
Barney, Everyone is in this video. Randy's in the video.," First of all, that line makes me sound like a hooker and saying it makes me feel like a hooker, so.  I don't want to brag, but in 29 takes, I only threw up thrice."
Barney, I'll say this: There is no quit in that guy. You should f*re him.," Okay, I can fix this. I am all over this project.  Okay, that, that right there. That attitude is exactly why I won't be in your video. Because GNB doesn't care. They hand out pink slips like they're hors d'oevres. Just last week, I was talking to Arthur..."
Barney," Marshall popped his cherry! Oh! Come on, Marshall, you have to admit, the guy was a disaster. I mean, it reflected badly on the company. He was an embarrassment. A huge embarrassment."," Sorry, Randy, but... this just isn't working out.  You slept with Randy!"
Barney," See, Marshall, if getting fired is an execution, at least the guy had a last meal. I promise you, tomorrow you'll feel a lot better."," That's...exactly what happened.  Randy, hey, what's going on?"
Barney," Uh-oh. I know that smile. Lily, there's no easy way to say this. Marshall's d*ad. Randy m*rder him."," Hey, guys.  No. I know why Randy is smiling. You're smiling because of Robin."
Barney," Anyhoo, while I got you-- big smile. We care about making dreams come true, in three, two..."," Oh, we'll see about that.  No!"
Barney," I'm not even here. Randy, the coffee."," I've been meaning to clean out that file cabinet for ages.  Oh! Okay. Okay. Thank you, Randy. I've been meaning to cut back on my caffeine."
Barney," Here, try this, but really go for it. Remember, this guy ruined your life."," Oh! Okay. Okay. Thank you, Randy. I've been meaning to cut back on my caffeine.  That's just the pick-me-up I needed."
Barney," Speaking of pickups, can we try the first one again?", That's just the pick-me-up I needed.  Hello.
Barney, Yep. That's a wrap., I care about making dreams come true. You got what you need?
Barney," Exactly. I say, Marshall, my good man, how's my bow tie?"," She ruined crossword day! I can't believe this. She singles me out by name. Calls me a fat cat. Me and my fat-cat friends. We're not fat cats.  Impeccable, old bean. To industry!"
Barney," Ah, bully!"," Impeccable, old bean. To industry!  Okay, that night we weren't entirely un-fat-catty. You see, every year the Natural History Museum holds its Autumn Spectacular. It's attended by some of the most powerful and important people in New York, and, thanks to Goliath National Bank... us."
Barney," Wow, that's pretty cool. When I was a kid, I knocked down the blue whale."," Ooh.  Okay, the giant blue whale hanging from the ceiling?"
Barney," I was six. My uncle Jerry brought me here for the day. He said, Don't touch anything. To a kid. That's like someone telling us Don't look at that girl's perky and impossibly symmetrical knockers."," Okay, the giant blue whale hanging from the ceiling?  Ooh."
Barney," So, naturally, I snapped the rib off a triceratops, blahbity-blahbity-blue, I knocked down the whale. I'm surprised security didn't stop me on the way in."," Not bad.  Well, I'm sure they don't remember. I mean, it's been like 30 years since that completely made-up story didn't happen."
Barney, It happened. And these people don't forget. This is not the Natural Stuff That Happened No More Than Five Minutes Ago Museum. Huh?," Well, I'm sure they don't remember. I mean, it's been like 30 years since that completely made-up story didn't happen.  Marshall, Barney, there you are. I want you to meet an old friend of mine from Exeter, George Van Smoot."
Barney, The Captain?," The Captain?  Back in school we met during a production ofGuys and Dolls. The Captain was Nathan Detroit to my assistant stage manager. Marshall and Barney here, are the future of Goliath National Bank."
Barney, Ahoy.," Well, ahoy.  Ahoy, The Captain."
Barney, Challenge accepted.," Thank you, The Captain.  Wow. The future of Goliath National Bank?"
Barney," Ah, that's the stuff."," I think I'm going to say yes.  I didn't realize you were small potatoes. And to be clear, I am referring to your testicles."
Barney, Impressive. Try this on for size.," I didn't realize you were small potatoes. And to be clear, I am referring to your testicles.  You want to dance? Let's dance."
Barney, I live for the dance., You want to dance? Let's dance.  Get... your other hand... off my ass.
Barney," Sorry, sorry."," Get... your other hand... off my ass.  What do you mean, you're going to say yes?"
Barney," This is ridiculous. We are two grown adults standing among the greatest collection of natural artifacts in the Western hemisphere, and look at what we're doing."," Mmm. Ah, this Scotch is good. How's your drink?  You're right."
Barney, Want to go touch a bunch of stuff?," You're right.  Yeah, I do."
Barney, Niled it.," Okay. Lily, what do you want from me? I want you to be the person I fell in love with.  Excuse me."
Barney, Thank God you're here. She's been messing with the exhibits., Excuse me.  I got married when I was 22 to a man who calls himself The Captain.
Barney," Oh, yeah, that story is legend... (phone ringing) Hold on....dary. And, um, would you happen to know what that young man's name was?"," Oh no, not just someone. A six-year-old.  No. But I could, uh, check the files."
Barney, Thank you.," No. But I could, uh, check the files.  Now, Arthur, your turn. I just sang three songs. Now you-you do your part fromGuys and Dolls."
Barney," Who's the master, Leroy?"," July 23,'81, incident report. At approximately 1000 hours,...vandal dislodged rib from triceratops skeleton...and flung said rib at giant whale. Causing said giant whale to fall in a downward trajectory. And the vandal's name... Well, I'll be damned... Barney Stinson.  Stinson was reprimanded and returned to the custody of his father, Jerome Whittaker."
Barney," Uh, no, uncle. Jerome Whittaker is my uncle."," Stinson was reprimanded and returned to the custody of his father, Jerome Whittaker.  Uncle Jerry. Says father. Even signed it and checked the box for father and everything."
Barney, Jerry's my uncle.," Uncle Jerry. Says father. Even signed it and checked the box for father and everything.  Lily? Honey, what's wrong? You okay? Do you want a h*t of this sandwich?"
Barney," It was that day... July 23,'81. My mom got pretty mad that he let me destroy a New York City landmark.", So when was the last time you saw him?  Moms.
Barney, He never came around anymore after that. Think he moved away.," Moms.  Well, maybe the security guy had it wrong. You never know..."
Barney," But you do know, you do know. That's the thing. You know. He's my dad."," Well, maybe the security guy had it wrong. You never know...  Barney, do you want...?"
Barney," I don't want to do anything. Don't tell anyone about this, okay?"," Barney, do you want...?  I'm serious. It's a great look. I think it could come back, but one question. Does it cost half as much as glasses?"
Barney, Thank you.," Oh, you're wearing a flower.  Ah, didn't compliment. Just observed."
Barney, I know. Isn't it?," Ah, didn't compliment. Just observed.  Why are you wearing that?"
Barney," Exactly. Science. There is an 83% correlation between the times men wear boutonnieres and the times they get laid. Think about it. Proms, weddings. Grandmas' funerals. Thanks for the redhead, Nana. The everyday boutonniere by Stinson."," Why does Barney do anything ever?  And nope. I'm sorry, Barney, but no girl is going home with a guy with a flower on his chest. Unless he's a clown, and she's in the trunk of his car."
Barney," Robin, did you know that boutonniere is French for bootie is near? True story. Une histoire vraie.", Along with 50 other clowns. It's a clown car. Oh.  Hmm! Did you know that Barney is French for sad little guy who works way too hard to get laid
Barney," Woman, you best check yourself."," Hmm! Did you know that Barney is French for sad little guy who works way too hard to get laid  Yeah, on the bright side, I guess suits are pretty boring without them, so..."
Barney, Madam... that is an insult that cannot be borne! I demand satisfaction!," Yeah, on the bright side, I guess suits are pretty boring without them, so...  What, are we gonna duel?"
Barney," No. I'm going to show everyone this embarrassing video of you. It's Robin Sparkles III, y'all!"," What, are we gonna duel?  Kids, by this point, we knew Aunt Robin had been a teen pop sensation in Canada, known as Robin Sparkles. And we also knew that her Robin Sparkles character came from a Canadian TV show, which we'd never seen... until now."
Barney, I cannot wait to see what's on this DVD!," Kids, by this point, we knew Aunt Robin had been a teen pop sensation in Canada, known as Robin Sparkles. And we also knew that her Robin Sparkles character came from a Canadian TV show, which we'd never seen... until now.  Oh, you haven't watched it yet?"
Barney," No, of course not. I wanted my first time to be with someone I cared about."," Oh, you haven't watched it yet?  Sweet! I get that a lot. Well, once."
Barney, Space Teens?! Is this a p*rn?," Yeah, I figured I should get one now because once I get pregnant, no more massages. Just so annoying.  No, no. Dude, dude. Sweet! It's a kids' show."
Barney," Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a big old bowl of p*rn. Whoa! And who is this exquisite keytarist I assum you're about to make sweet love to?"," I don't know. This does have all the earmarks of p*rn. Stripper pole, bad lighting, delusional girl who thinks it's a stepping stone to mainstream success.  Oh, that's Jessica Glitter. She was my BFF on the show and in real life."
Barney," Ah, BFFs. Did you guys have sleepovers? Get mad at each other and wrestle, but then end up kissing in a tender embrace? Here, show us on Lily."," Oh, that's Jessica Glitter. She was my BFF on the show and in real life.  Barney, you know what? If you're going to be disgusting, we're not watching this, okay?"
Barney," I'm sorry. We got to ration this. It's like we're on a desert island, and this video is a really hot, naked chick, and she's got, like, seaweed on her and a seashell bra. You all feel me?"," Don't stop now! Almost there! 23 times three?  Hey, if you and Jessica are BFFs, how come we've never met her?"
Barney, The last thing she would want to do is hang out with some little brat.," Of course. Robin hates kids.  Thus, if I may... When Glitter's womb a fruit did bear, Robin said, To hell with this, I'm outta hare. Glitter got pregnant, so Robin dumped her."
Barney, Two dudes on the couch together watching p*rn? That's kind of weird.," Just watch it without me.  Okay, it's not p*rn, it's a kids' show."
Barney, We...," Okay, fine, I'll watch it with you. Yeah! But if either of you makes even one peep about the show being dirty, I'm turning it off.  I'm serious."
Barney, It's a noble creature.," The beaver is the official animal of Canada. It's our national mascot.  Okay, girls. Everyone knows a beaver's favorite food is wood. I just hope we brought along enough of it for our three-day galactic space journey. So let's do the math. If Robin's beaver devours six inches of wood every half hour, and Jessica's beaver devours eight inches of wood every 45 minutes, how much wood will I need to keep both of these beavers well-fed all weekend long? While you figure it out at home, how about we sing you a song about our beavers?"
Barney, No arguments here.," Hey! No! You don't get to hear the beaver song! It is a sweet song about friendship, and you guys are being disgusting, and beavers are adorable!  'Sup Shmosby!"
Barney," Seriously, dude, he has got to go. You need to be like, You are the weakest link. Goodbye. Punchy, the tribe has spoken. Please pack up your knives and go. Your work of art didn't work for us. Your time's up. I have to ask you to leave the mansion. You must leave the chateau. Your tour ends here. You've been chopped."," I'm going to go pee in the jar I got going in the alley.  Okay, yeah. I know."
Barney," You've been evicted from the Big Brother house. Your dessert just didn't measure up. Sashay away. Give me your jacket and leave Hell's Kitchen. I'm sorry, you did not get a rose. You have been eliminated from the race. You are no longer in the running to be America's Next Top Model. You're fired. Auf Wiedersehen."," Okay, yeah. I know.  Ted, come look at this. I found a little wounded bird in the alley."
Barney, Where do I know this song from?," Me, too.  Oh, my God. It's the beaver song. Okay, which one of you put this on?"
Barney, Wow. This is so dirty.," * Ice cream cone; We'll lick it side by side *  Come on, Barney. It's a sweet song about friendship."
Barney," What? No! You can't go now. It's the night before Thanksgiving. College chicks are back in town. Their moms just made a snide comment about the weight they gained. They called her a bitch, but deep down, they know she's right. And they're about to walk through that door, where we will be waiting with some light beer and some rock hard approval. Wh-what u-up?"," Your loss. All right, it's d*ad in here. I'm gonna call it a little early.  Yeah. You don't want to bail early, man. You could become The Blitz."
Barney, My Blitzy lies over the ocean; My Blitzy lies over the sea; My Blitzy lies over the ocean; So bring back my Blitzy...," Aw, man! No, no! Let's get one thing straight, okay? I am not The Blitz.  Please stop. Okay, fine."
Barney,...To me.," Please stop. Okay, fine.  The Gentleman!"
Barney," And then I'm just going to leave her there... buck-naked, covered in candle wax, tied to the bed."," Okay, well, we all started brainstorming ways to mess with her. There were a lot of different ideas kicking around.  Barney, I know that Ted doesn't like that girl, but that's a little extreme."
Barney, Wait... Ted doesn't like that girl?," Barney, I know that Ted doesn't like that girl, but that's a little extreme.  Okay. Wh...? Well, I got it. You see that silk scarf? I'm going to steal it."
Barney," It was legen-- wait for Ted to leave, 'cause he's now The Blitz-- -- dary. Legendary!"," Oh, I was there for the whole thing. Something inside me just said Grand Theft Auto can wait a night.  I'm not The Blitz!"
Barney," Well, not anymore, Blitz."," I'm finally free! I mean, you have no idea what I've missed all these years: The university president's toupee being snatched by a hawk at graduation, Zeppelin reuniting at my cousin Ira's bar mitzvah, countless nip-slips, crotch sh*ts, sh**ting stars and double rainbows. I've missed them all!  My name's not Blitz. My name is Steve! Colors seem so bright now. Thank you, Blitz."
Barney," Hey, Robin, you should dance on the oven.", The oven.  Make out with Zoey! Make out with Zoey! Make out...
Barney," Full disclosure. We also used all your butter, greasing up Lily so we could see how far we could slide her down the hall."," Great. So not only did you guys betray me, but you broke my oven on Thanksgiving?  But if it helps, I reached 4G."
Barney, Huh. I should probably disconnect the gas.," Barney, I don't know if the oven is deep enough. Plus, it's a display made of cardboard.  Hey, just so you guys know, there was a tiny expl*si*n at the sewage treatment plant across the street from our apartment, but I'm sure it's fine by now."
Barney, Um... Um... I'm have... I'm having trouble breathing!," I think the smaller turkey just tried to crawl further inside the bigger turkey.  Mom keeps an extra litter box in here. There you go. Good as new. Oh. Hey, Ginger."
Barney," And here's the twist, Babaka. Because Ted left early, he's now The Blitz."," Guys? Wait a minute. Where's Barney?  But Barney, now you left the group. Wouldn't that put you in danger of becoming The Blitz yourself?"
Barney, No. I c... Because... Step on it.," But Barney, now you left the group. Wouldn't that put you in danger of becoming The Blitz yourself?  You missed it."
Barney, But he's The Blitz., Tony Bennett passed Ted the mike and he sang Twist and Shout!  No. I'm not The Blitz. I'm The Bueller. You know what this means. You're The Blitz.
Barney," Oh, God, no!"," Blitz...  Life moves pretty fast, Barney. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you might miss it."
Barney, Sure. But... no one move while I'm gone. (whispering): I'm scared.," Barney, could you get me some more ice?  You're safe. It's okay to leave the room. You have to actually leave the building for something cool to happen."
Barney, Thanks. You're the only one who's nice to me about this.," You're safe. It's okay to leave the room. You have to actually leave the building for something cool to happen.  Okay, I got to test this."
Barney, What happened?," Okay, I got to test this.  You missed it!"
Barney," Aw, man! You said I could leave the room!"," Dude, you walked out of the room, the laws of physics stopped and the laws of awesome tripled.  I just wanted to see something cool happen. I'm sorry. But I was on that island for what seems like eternity. I'm going to enjoy things on the other side."
Barney," No! Y-You... Robin, Robin. I will pay you to be The Blitz. $100! No-- $10,000. No-- 60 bucks. That's a lot of money for someone like you."," I just wanted to see something cool happen. I'm sorry. But I was on that island for what seems like eternity. I'm going to enjoy things on the other side.  Dude, The Blitz isn't something that can be bought or sold."
Barney," That is amazing. And I was here for it. Now Zoey is The Blitz. Ha, ha! (weak laugh) Burn on her."," Uh, did Wang Guy just quote Gandhi?  Come on, man. Don't be that Blitz."
Barney, I'm not any Blitz! You're The Blitz! You're all The Blitz! I slept with that cute Indian girl who cuts my hair!," Come on, man. Don't be that Blitz.  What does that have to do with anything?"
Barney, Nothing! I just forgot to brag about it before!," What does that have to do with anything?  Guys, despite the wit and wisdom of Wang Guy, Zoey and I are never going to be friends. We're just here for her oven and that's it."
Barney," Hey, guys, the most amazing thing just happened to me in that other roo... Aw, man.", Wait... Where's Barney?  I don't get it. Why'd she just kick us out like that?
Barney," Aw, man! Wait. Which half?"," Barney was here? I was walking around half-naked.  Look, I'm sorry your stepdaughter didn't want to spend Thanksgiving with you."
Barney, What happened? I saw it!," The Gentleman!  Aw, come on, Blitz. Now it's just sad. Aw, man. Oh, go ahead. I forgot my jacket."
Barney," Thank you, God!"," Oh, hold the door!  Blitz."
Barney," Everything he said was nice, but I am profoundly scared.", Okay. That man is terrifying.  Keep smiling. He can still see us.
Barney," Captain, what do you think of rainy days?"," Yeah. I snapped this photo of him last time he dropped off Zoey.Observe. The bottom half of his face... is smiling. He seems happy. Seems like a nice guy.(everyone is murmuring happily)But the top half of his face...wants to m*rder you! Cheerful. Wants to m*rder you. No. Cheerful. Wants to m*rder you. Now, hold on. Let me ask him a question. Captain, what do you think of ice cream? Oh, he loves it!  Whoa, he hates them."
Barney, And I'll be home trying to get over the fact that no one invited meto the big hair washing party.," Holding the towel.  All right, fine. Guess it'll just be me and Zoey."
Barney, Don't use the husband's condoms. That's just rude.," Oh, wait. Just the two of you? Tread lightly, Mosby. Any time a single guy hangs out with a married woman, there are rules that must be followed. Rule number one...  Rule number one: don't go anywhere that has candles."
Barney, Lubricant is public property. (Robin groans), And the most important rule of all...  Please.
Barney," Lily, I guess that leaves just you and me. Want to hang?", Oh! Sweet. No candles.  And then Lily said something to Barney that insulted every fiber of his being.
Barney," Save it, Lily. I am still mad at you for... something, and for that other thing."," Barney.  Look, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. But let's be honest. You've been super sensitive lately."
Barney," No, I haven't! God, how can you say that?!"," Look, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. But let's be honest. You've been super sensitive lately.  Watch out!"
Barney," Oh! Wow. Thanks, Lily. You saved me. You saved us. Look, I know you didn't mean whatever it was you said that made me so mad.", Watch out!  I think I probably didn't.
Barney," So, who's the eye broccoli?"," Two years ago, I had just hired a new assistant at GNB.  Okay, that's Iris, my new assistant. And yes, she's a little plain, but I'm married, so that's good."
Barney," Mark my words, Marshall. Someday you will find Iris so excruciatingly attractive, you won't be able to look her directly in the boobs."," Okay, that's Iris, my new assistant. And yes, she's a little plain, but I'm married, so that's good.  I don't think that's gonna be a problem."
Barney," Marshall, do you know how the myth of mermaids came to be?", I don't think that's gonna be a problem.  I'm sorry. Myth?
Barney," It was 300 years ago. Sailors stuck at sea would get desperate for female companionship. It got so bad that, eventually, the manatees out in the water started to look like... beautiful women. Mermaids. Let's go get some tail! Oh. You see, every woman, no matter how initially repugnant, has a mermaid clock... the time it takes for you to realize you want to bone her. Sure, today you see Iris as a manatee. But she ain't gonna stay that way. Marshall, your secretary's mermaid clock starts right now."," I'm sorry. Myth?  And it took one year, three months, and 16 days, but eventually..."
Barney, D'oh! Told you. The Mermaid Theory. It's a thing. You owe me 500 bucks.," And it took one year, three months, and 16 days, but eventually...  Did we bet on this?"
Barney, Let's say yes., Did we bet on this?  And that's why we never hang out alone? Yes.
Barney," What's that supposed to mean? Are you calling me fat? If there is one thing you never do, it is call a woman fat right to her face!"," Seriously? I step away for five seconds, and you eat all my onion rings? No surprise there.  Wait. Barney's not a woman. That's right... Barney wasn't hurt by Lily, Lily was hurt by Barney."
Barney, Nah. Watch out!," Want to hang?  Wow... thanks, Barney. You saved me. You saved us."
Barney," Oh, Lily, I'm sorry. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?"," Okay, now I'm on track. The rest of this story should make perfect sense.  You're a jerk."
Barney," Once mermaid-ified, there's only one way a woman can go back to being unattractive again, but it's pretty gruesome.", I asked Barney the same thing.  Death?
Barney," Worse. Pregnancy. If a baby's on board that train, it is headed straight back to Manatee City... where the grass ain't green and the girls ain't pretty.", Death?  Pregnancy?
Barney," Well, Lily, I guess it's just you and me. You wanna hang?"," Wait! That's it! That's what Barney and Lily were fighting about! The Mermaid Theory! But their argument didn't happen at the same time as all this other stuff. I'm literally in the wrong year! It happened much, much later when Lily was... pregnant.  Nah. Whenever we're alone, you spend the whole time undressing me with your eyes. You even take off my shoes."
Barney," High heels chafe my shoulders. But you don't have to worry about that anymore. Ever since you got pregnant, you're just a big fat manatee."," Nah. Whenever we're alone, you spend the whole time undressing me with your eyes. You even take off my shoes.  Well, you're a big... stupid octopus face!"
Barney," I'm sorry, Lily. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?"," Wow. Thanks, Barney. You saved me. You saved us. If there's one thing you never do, it's call a woman fat right to her face!  Oh... You're a jerk."
Barney," Hey. Hey, wait. Come on. I was kid... Wait, wait, wait! There's another addendum to The Mermaid Theory. A pregnant woman who's become a manatee can become a mermaid again through one simple act.", Oh... You're a jerk. What's that?
Barney, Breast-feeding. Hot.,What's that?  Really?
Barney, Really. When those things swell up to three times their normal size... so do I., Really?  That's so sweet!
Barney, I've never seen that woman before in my life! Sorry. Force of habit. Congratulations!, What?!  To Lily and Marshall.
Barney," Hey, guys. A yuletide riddle. What is my second favorite word that begins with b-o-n?", And now she's totally winningCelebrity Rehab.  Bon Jovi?
Barney," Yeah. What is my third favorite word that begins with b-o-n?(Imitates buzzer)Bonus. As in, my end-of-the-year bonus check."," Bon Jovi?  My God, Barney! I work for GNB, too. All I got was $15 gift card to Costa Coffee."
Barney," And you earned it, buddy. Check out what I'm gonna buy for myself. The dibiase. See those pinstripes? Diamonds. It is the uppest a person could ever suit."," My God, Barney! I work for GNB, too. All I got was $15 gift card to Costa Coffee.  Uh, has it ever occurred to you to give some of this to charity?"
Barney," Charity? You're seriously talking to me about charity? Dude, I am Mr. Charity. I frequently sleep with sixes, chubsters, over-thirties... I am the bill and Melinda gates of the sympathy bang.(Marshall and Lily arrives)"," Uh, has it ever occurred to you to give some of this to charity?  Hey, guys. Big announcement."
Barney," What?! I've never seen that woman before in my life! Sorry, force of habit. Congratulations!", What?!  Huh. Marshall and Lily are doing something meaningful. And it's making me less happy about this bonus. And I'm still single. At least I got that going for me. So why do I still feel outside of awesome looking in? What am I doing with my life?
Barney, Huh. Marshall and Lily are doing something meaningful. And it's making me less happy about this bonus. And I'm still single. At least I got that going for me. So why do I still feel outside of awesome looking in? What am I doing with my life?," What?! I've never seen that woman before in my life! Sorry, force of habit. Congratulations!  we've never been happier. can't imagine bringing e down right now."
Barney," Oh, Marshall, you only think you're happy. Just wait, because tonight, (imitating Oprah) is Barney's Favorite Things!", we've never been happier. can't imagine bringing e down right now.  That was the reaction Barney expected. This was the one he got.
Barney," Barney's Favorite Things! I'm gonna give you all a bunch of free stuff... like Oprah. Just get excited, okay?", Huh? I don't know what that is.  The next hour got pretty weird.
Barney, Velour track suits!, The next hour got pretty weird.  Velour is so comfortable. They're so soft.
Barney," Remote control helicopters! Condoms! And last but not least... There is a fleet of limos outside waiting to take us to... A strip club! (Applause, cheering)You get a lap dance! You get a lap dance! You're gonna give me a lap dance! Everybody gets a lap dance! That was amazing! It was like a diamond suit for my soul. I gotta keep going. I gotta do more.", Velour is so comfortable. They're so soft.  No. No! I cannot go back to that strip club. I seen some things.
Barney, I'm not going back either. I'm taking the rest of my bonus to God's strip club.," No. No! I cannot go back to that strip club. I seen some things.  The next day, he paid a visit to the most charitable man he knew, his half-brother's father, Sam Gibbs, a minister at a church out on Long Island."
Barney," Sam. Uh, father. I-I don't mean father father. Unless..."," The next day, he paid a visit to the most charitable man he knew, his half-brother's father, Sam Gibbs, a minister at a church out on Long Island.  What's up, Barney?"
Barney, I'm thinking about giving some money to charity.," What's up, Barney?  Is that the name of the stripper you've been e-mailing me about? You got to take me off that list, Barney."
Barney," No, I don't mean that charity. That charity is doing peachy. You'll see pics of the two of them in next week's e-mail."," Is that the name of the stripper you've been e-mailing me about? You got to take me off that list, Barney.  What up! Barney, I'm a minister. Unsubscribe."
Barney," I-I recently started giving, and it felt surprisingly good. I want to do more."," What up! Barney, I'm a minister. Unsubscribe.  Well, now you're talking. We have this program that helps those in need get back on their feet. We give them food, a place to live, clothes for job interviews."
Barney," Well, I would love to help by writing a check for... one, zero, zero, zero..."," Well, now you're talking. We have this program that helps those in need get back on their feet. We give them food, a place to live, clothes for job interviews.  You're not pregnant."
Barney,"...Zero... (Cell phone chimes) Woops. Hold on a second. Wait. They're not doing something meaningful with their lives. Well, this changes everything. Oh, no, I've already written four zeroes. Thank you, decimal point. One hundred dollars."," You're not pregnant.  That's great. Thank you, Barney!"
Barney," Diamond suited up. Hey, Ted, can you spot me for the movie? I don't like to carry a lot of cash on me."," That's great. Thank you, Barney!  What happened to giving the money away?"
Barney," Yeah, that was back when Lily was pregnant. Now she's not. Ergo, a suit is born. (Chuckles)Dude, what's up with the gingerbread house? You look ridiculous!", What happened to giving the money away?  It's a Christmas-themed movie snack!
Barney," Ah, I know that move. You cut a hole in the floor, she reaches into the living room, finds the tree... Nice.", It's a Christmas-themed movie snack!  Where the hell are Marshall and Lily?
Barney," What?! I've never seen that woman before in my life! Sorry, force of habit. Congratulations!"," What?!  This is great. I'm happy. I'm so happy, my heart's pounding. And I'm sweating. And I can't breathe. This is what happiness feels like, right? Oh, crap. Lily's having a baby and I'm having a panic att*ck. I hope she can't tell what I'm thinking right now."
Barney, What am I doing with my life?, What am I doing with my life?  I should get a Christmas-themed movie snack for tomorrow night.
Barney, Get a puppy!," Yeah, we were thinking maybe we would just get a dog.  Can you imagine... That would be the cutest thing!"
Barney, Oh. Our movie snack.," No!  Are you kidding me?! All you ever talk about is having kids! And now you have one little freak-out and you want to get a dog instead?! No. Unacceptable! You're gonna turn around, you're gonna go home, get naked, lie together as man and wife until Lily is great with child. Right now! I'm serious! Go, go, go!"
Barney, Marshall and Lily got in trouble.," Are you kidding me?! All you ever talk about is having kids! And now you have one little freak-out and you want to get a dog instead?! No. Unacceptable! You're gonna turn around, you're gonna go home, get naked, lie together as man and wife until Lily is great with child. Right now! I'm serious! Go, go, go!  And you! Ooh. Barney, you look real stupid in that suit. You're gonna go get your money back and give it to charity. And I don't mean that stripper you keep e-mailing us about, even though we beg you to take us off that list."
Barney," I can't give this suit back. Ted, I glow in the dark. I finally glow in the dark!"," And you! Ooh. Barney, you look real stupid in that suit. You're gonna go get your money back and give it to charity. And I don't mean that stripper you keep e-mailing us about, even though we beg you to take us off that list.  Criminals of New York! Attention! This man is wearing a diamond-covered suit! You could retire on the pants alone! Merry Christmas!"
Barney, Nope.," Wow. That's a lot of zeroes. Y-you sure you're not missing a decimal point?  And that's the tour. Uh, staff meeting's at noon, you'll meet everyone there, but first you need to head down to security. You need to get your picture taken. For your I.D. badge."
Barney, And there's more. Do you still do that thing where you give people in need clothes for job interviews?, Positive.  Yeah. Why?
Barney," Bring 'em in, boys! Merry Christmas."," Yeah. Why?  Thank you, son."
Barney, Son?!," Thank you, son.  It's just an expression. I'm still not your dad."
Barney," Hi, there. We've had a lot of fun tonight, but on a more serious note, this is the time of year when we remember the importance of giving. And there's no greater gift than the gift of booty. So, this holiday season, why not bang someone in need? I'm Barney Stinson, and that's... One to grow on."," Scherbatsky... I'm gonna crush it.  Um, no."
Barney," Hi, there. You know, we've had a lot of fun tonight..."," Um, no."
Barney," Guys, we've got a problem. This is the application for the regional doubles laser tag tournament in Poughkeepsie. Problem is, only one of you can be my partner. So it looks like we've got a bake-off. You may now present your arguments."," Well, what's your plan, Marshall, just have unprotected sex day after day after day in every position imaginable until...? Wait, it sounded worse in my head.  I'm not playing laser tag."
Barney, And Marshall's the winner.," Damn it.  Well, I'm gonna call Dr. Stangel. It can't hurt."
Barney," Yeah, and it cuts in and out.", So I understand you want to get pregnant.  Ooh! How did you do it?
Barney," Oh, God, you found one of the cameras. I swear that's the only one. Wait, which one did you find?", Ooh! How did you do it?  What are you talking about?
Barney, What are you talking about?, What are you talking about?  My visit to a certain Dr. Stangel.
Barney, Not today I wasn't.," Wait, so you weren't wearing a fake beard and examining girl parts all day?  Wow, we finally found Barney's doppelganger. I guess we can tell you now, Lily. That hot dog guy did not look like Barney."
Barney, Or... or cost-saving alternative: you could get checked out by someone who looks just like him. I'm gonna go scrub up. I'll meet you in stall three.," No, we've made a binding covenant with the universe. We said we weren't going to try to have kids until we saw Barney's doppelganger. Oh, this is bad news. This is like a black cat walked through my uterus. Okay, that's it. I am going back to Dr. Stangel and getting thoroughly checked out.  I still kind of think it's Barney."
Barney," Wow, it is like looking into a poorly dressed mirror."," No, Barney... Doctor, wait, please, it's... Can you just give us a couple minutes? I... Lily, how can I convince you that this is not Barney?  Okay, you have to go. Leave the model of the vagina."
Barney," How you doing, Lily?! Should I have a boner?!"," Yeah, I'm sorry, but unless I see Barney at the same time, I... I'll never be sure that Dr. Stangel isn't him.  Okay, we're all done. I'll call you in a few days with the results."
Barney," Hey, you don't mind if I take pictures, do you?!", Thank you.  Can we leave him in here for a while?
Barney," Aw, yeah. Smile for the birdie, Lil! Gyno-mite!"," I'm done for the day. You can leave him in here all night.  Now, while all this was going on, your Aunt Robin was starting her new job at World Wide News, aka the big leagues. She was excited. This job was a new start, a clean slate."
Barney, Problem?! You can't get a girl pregnant. That's the dream. I'd give my firstborn to not be able to have children.," Well, I was just putting on a brave face. Okay, think about it: we've had unprotected sex 203 times in the past four months. Obviously I'm the problem.  So, second day of work?"
Barney," Exactly! Or when your... I don't know... friend invites you to a laser tag tournament, you don't fight it. You just strap on the vinyl holster and race into that abandoned JCPenney g*n a-blazin'. I'm just agreeing with Ted."," Robin, a word of advice: play along. Okay, the more you fight it, the worse it's going to get. It's like when your car slides on ice, you steer into the skid.  Oh, it's my dad."
Barney," I'll show you. Dad, there's, uh, there's something I need to tell you, and it's going to come as a bit of a shock to you, but here goes. You are speaking to the 2011 Tri-County Laser Tag Co-Champion."," But the news that I might not be able to give him a grandchild? You know, like, I don't even know how to have that conversation.  Barney, I've already told..."
Barney," Oh, and my sperm don't work. Yeah, yeah, the laser tag thing is awesome.The appartment"," Barney, I've already told...  So, third day of work?"
Barney," Think about it, Marshall. All entrants get 20% off at the snack bar! Oh, BT-dub, the receptionist. What's her situation?"," Damn it, Barney! What are you doing in here?  Go! Well, Marshall. I've got your results."
Barney," Bro, that is awesome. Motility five!"," Count, motility... everything's off the charts. You, sir, have got some strong swimmers.  Hey, um, can I borrow your phone? I want to call my dad."
Barney, She said doody.," Judy duty.  Really, guys? At a funeral?"
Barney," Wait a minute! Today, we are gonna make Marshall laugh."," Uh, okay, while not all of us possess your lofty sense of decorum, Drug-DealerFrom-An-'80s-After-School-Special, we have to laugh today. It's healthy.  How?"
Barney," Ted, what's the one thing that always cracks him up?", How?  Internet footage of a guy getting h*t in the nuts.
Barney," Internet footage of a guy getting h*t in the nuts, exactly! So we are gonna get our bro a four-star nad rattler. You search knees, feet, banisters, f*re hydrants and diving boards, and I'll cover bats, rackets, hockey sticks, golf clubs and riding crops.", Internet footage of a guy getting h*t in the nuts.  What about animals?
Barney," Uh... Claws, paws, talons, hooves, beaks and clenched monkey fists. We can do this!"," What about animals?  Hey, guys, sorry, uh... I left my charger back in New York, so my phone's out of juice. Does anyone have...?"
Barney," Marshall Eriksen, you could use a laugh."," Yeah, well, your lunch money finally ran out. Kidding!  Yeah! This video is entitled, Little League Coach Gets h*t in the Nuts by a Foul Ball and Then Vomits in a Garbage Can. I don't wanna give anything away. Let's just watch."
Barney, Oh!," Yeah! This video is entitled, Little League Coach Gets h*t in the Nuts by a Foul Ball and Then Vomits in a Garbage Can. I don't wanna give anything away. Let's just watch.  See? 'Cause, 'cause he got h*t..."
Barney," See? 'Cause, 'cause he got h*t..."," Oh! ...right in the nuts,"
Barney, The fat kid just runs away.,"...right in the nuts,  Trey Platt. I can't believe my father's funeral service is being led by Trey The Noogie Machine Platt."
Barney," This next clip is entitled, Guy Playing Bagpipes Gets h*t in the Nuts by Low-Flying Seagull", This is worse than the pork chop.  Let's see what happens.
Barney, Here he comes... Oh! Oh! 'Cause he gets h*t right in the nuts., Let's see what happens.  And then the fat kid loses his swim trunks.
Barney, Fall off. Shorts just fall right off.," And then the fat kid loses his swim trunks.  No, wait-- I'm wrong. That wasn't it. They couldn't find a cab, so I went down there."
Barney," Exactly. All those famous last word people supposedly said? They're all made up. Like that patriotic dude, Nathan Hale, from third-grade history?"," She's right. I mean, this idea that someone's last words have to be profound and meaningful? I mean, who can live up to that?  My I only regret is I have but one life to lose for my country."
Barney, You know what his real last words were?, My I only regret is I have but one life to lose for my country.  I'm peeing my pants!
Barney, True story.," I'm peeing my pants!  The point is, last words are overrated."
Barney, So?," Hey, stay hydrated.  I couldn't listen to it. Guys, this is hard."
Barney, It doesn't. That's true.," We know, baby. But you'll always wonder, if you don't. Your dad loved you. It almost doesn't matter what he said.  Guys, guys, what if-- God forbid-- all of your dads died right now? What would their last words to you have been? Seriously."
Barney," Man, I always thought I had it rough not really knowing my dad, but... now I realize at least I'll never have to suffer like this. Our next video is called German Shepherd Activates Tennis Ball Cannon While Fat Kid Sips Energy Drink."," Yes.  Barney, please, Barney! It's... No more videos, okay? I just need a minute."
Barney, And here's your phone number back.," Whoa, they grow big out here.  Judy, I..."
Barney, Yeah. Showing videos of guys getting h*t in the nuts wasn't going to do anything. I'm just stupid.," Well, at least someone's helping. We haven't made Marshall laugh once.  Stupid."
Barney, What we need to do is h*t each other in the nuts., Stupid.  Yes. Nothing beats the immediacy of live theater. But which one of us is going to take the h*t?(Barney hits Ted in the nuts)So that's it? No discussion?
Barney, Lame.," You know something, gorgeous, I'm the luckiest man alive.  These stories suck."
Barney, She's right. Your dad was hilarious.," Hey, so it's a pocket dial. You have so many great memories with your dad. Who cares about the last one?  You guys don't get it, okay? None of you do. My dad was my hero. And he was my teacher. And he was my best friend. He always came through for me. And now he's just gone. And what am I left with? (scratchy electronic sounds)Thanks a lot, God! Thank you! You took my father, the greatest man that I have ever known, and you ripped him off this Earth, way too young! And he'll never get to meet our kids, Lily.(scratchy sounds continue)But we got this voice mail. Thank you so much for the voice mail! It's a great comfort! 'Cause whenever I'm starting to feel lonely or sad, or-- or you know what, or maybe a little bit cheated, at least I got the sound of his pocket to console me. How is this fair? You know, like, an entire human life and it just ends for no reason, and... and what are we left with?"
Barney," Hey, Mom. I'm ready to meet my dad."," Hi, Dad."
Barney, I hope I can pass this hot dog., Could someone pass the ketchup?  Oh.Oops.
Barney, Cute means fat," Don't worry, Ted, she's cute.  She's not fat."
Barney, Not fat means ugly," She's not fat.  Oh, here she is."
Barney, I take back everything I said. That girl is extremely attractive.," Oh, here she is.  Hey, Zoey."
Barney," Oh, honey."," Yeah, I always get those e- mails from Michelle Obama and sometimes Obama himself.  So the night went on, and eventually everyone went home, except for Ted and Honey."
Barney, Why do they call 'em coasters?," Wow, an architect. How fascinating.  And Barney."
Barney," Ted, a word. God, I hate these situations. What are we gonna do about this?"," Okay, time to go home.  What are you talking about?"
Barney," Come on, Ted, it's obvious. Honey's vibing on me.", What are you talking about?  What?
Barney, It's called body language. Remember when she was touching your arm and leaning in real close?, What?  Mm-hmm.
Barney," Well, while that was happening, the straw in her drink was pointed right at me. I mean... that's as clear as a signal gets, so... I'm so sorry, man."," Mm-hmm.  You're right. She's all yours, buddy. I'd say hump her brains out, but someone obviously already has."
Barney, Does anyone know why we're here?," Funny you should say that.  Yeah, who called this intervention?"
Barney," Guys, just let the man explain how it's all about his wearing a lady's watch."," Hmm, no, it's the shoulder hair.  It's because I'm in love with Zoey, and she's married, so it needs to stop. And... intervene."
Barney," Hey, Marshall."," Well, it would be. Good-bye. Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking.  Barney. W- What number is this?"
Barney," I'm up on burners, playa. Too many crazies had my old number, so now I'm all about disposable cell phones. I'll use one for a while, have my fun, then dump it and get a new one. And then I'll do the same with my phone."," Barney. W- What number is this?  Hey, uh, so Robin told me about this whole Ted and Zoey thing."
Barney," Dude, she doesn't know how to tell a story. I'll tell you that story."," Hey, uh, so Robin told me about this whole Ted and Zoey thing.  Hey, Zoey."
Barney," That is exactly how it happened. So Ted did his best to impress her, but as per yoozh, he bored the pants very much on her."," Uh... Robin's version was...  Blah, blah, blah, I'm an architect. Blah, blah, blah, I don't wear suits. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
Barney, Coaster.," Straw.  Okay, time to go home."
Barney," Anyway, I get Honey back to her place."," Okay, time to go home.  Who's your daddy?"
Barney, Who's your daddy?," Anyway, I get Honey back to her place.  Okay, can we skip this part, please?"
Barney," Sure, I'll just summarize it.(imitating squeaky bedsprings)"," Okay, can we skip this part, please?  Okay, that's been going on a while."
Barney," Only way I know how. Any-who, next day, I'm going into work. I run into Zoey."," Okay, that's been going on a while.  Hey, Zoey. That cousin of yours... Honey... yowsa! I must say, your family tree has got a couple of pretty big coconuts."
Barney," Hey, Zoey. That cousin of yours... Honey... yowsa! I must say, your family tree has got a couple of pretty big coconuts."," Only way I know how. Any-who, next day, I'm going into work. I run into Zoey.  Thanks."
Barney," Yeah, we had a great time last night. And then just hand stuff in the morning, so..."," Thanks.  Wait, she didn't go home with Ted?"
Barney," Nope, he let me have her. I have to say, it was pretty noble of him. He fell on his sword so that she could fall on mine. I won't bore you with the details, but to summarize... (imitating squeaky bedsprings)"," Wait, she didn't go home with Ted?  Zoey's in love with Ted."
Barney, Who's your daddy?," Oh, yeah. He's such a sweet guy.  Oh... Who's your daddy?"
Barney, I don't know., Oh... Who's your daddy?  I guess he recently decided to get in touch with his dad. His mom gave him the guy's address.
Barney, So I wrote him a letter. And I poured my heart out. And I gave him my number and I told him to call me. And he still hasn't called me.," I guess he recently decided to get in touch with his dad. His mom gave him the guy's address.  Oh, honey."
Barney," I mean, I shouldn't be surprised. Clearly, he wants nothing to do with me."," Oh, honey.  Oh, honey."
Barney," I mean, why else would he let 30 years go by? He's ashamed to have me as a son."," Oh, honey.  Oh, honey, he's not ashamed of you. He's ashamed of himself. I mean, look at you. You're do so great without him. I mean, you have an airline and three Nobel Prizes, and you play for the Yankees."
Barney, Four. Four Nobel Prizes.," Oh, honey, he's not ashamed of you. He's ashamed of himself. I mean, look at you. You're do so great without him. I mean, you have an airline and three Nobel Prizes, and you play for the Yankees.  Four. See? That is impressive. I mean, how many does he have?"
Barney, Only three.," Four. See? That is impressive. I mean, how many does he have?  Well, there you go."
Barney,"You're doing this all wrong! Ted, there are couples in my kindergarten class who have moved faster than you two. Granted, their home lives are not great."," My friends, as usual, were completely supportive.  Hey, I'm trying. I keep suggesting these big, romantic dates, and she keeps putting on the brakes. Like tonight, she wants me to just come over and bake cookies."
Barney,Total booty-call.,"Oh. Translation: booty-call.  Private Booty, reporting for duty."
Barney,"Wow, you sound really lonely."," Except Marshall's brothers had taped over it with Predator. And it became a tradition.  I am. Earlier today, I burst into tears..."
Barney,"Shh. Daddy's talking now. Loneliness. The looming specter of Valentine's Day fast approaching. The two key ingredients to my favorite day of the year, February 13: Desperation Day."," I am. Earlier today, I burst into tears... That's not a thing."
Barney,"It's a thing. Much like Valentine's Day itself, Desperation Day dates back thousands of years. Weddings were forbidden under ancient Roman law, so Saint Valentine performed them in secret, under thr*at of death.",That's not a thing.  That's actually true.
Barney,"Wait, there's more.", That's actually true.  This won't be.
Barney,"And right by Saint Valentine's side was his best bro, Saint Desperatius, there to pick off insecure bridesmaids.", This won't be.  Whoa. Check out that one. Her body is a perfect X.
Barney,"Every woman wants a date on Valentine's Day. That neediness reaches its climax... what up... on February 13. A magical night when a ten has the self-esteem of a four and the depraved enthusiasm of a two. Now, there's only one thing you can't do.", And I thought Pompeii was smokin'. Please say widows.
Barney,"Wherever you are, or whoever you're under, you must get home alone by 11:59 p.m. Otherwise, you're on a date on Valentine's Day.","Please say widows. Barney, Desperation Day assumes that all single women freak out about Valentine's Day. Which we do not. Case in point, I will be spending February 13 with some lovely single ladies from work..."
Barney,Trolls.,"Barney, Desperation Day assumes that all single women freak out about Valentine's Day. Which we do not. Case in point, I will be spending February 13 with some lovely single ladies from work... ...who could care less about Valentine's Day."
Barney,Lying trolls.,"...who could care less about Valentine's Day. And we will be celebrating the fact that we don't have to spend it with some dippy guy carting around roses and stuffed toys all night. Oh, no offense, Ted."
Barney," You losing your mind, being alone in your apartment?", I decided to go to Minnesota to see Marshall. He shouldn't have to help his mom through this rough time all by himself.  I'm getting weird!
Barney,"We said you were going to have sex. We didn't say, Bring a carry-on.", You guys said I was definitely going to spend the night. So how did Zoey react?
Barney,"God, these girls are so hungry for male attention. It is like being a hunter and having the deer walk up, tie itself to the hood of your car and beg to get mounted."," Meanwhile, as Desperation Day turned into Desperation Night... Barney, this is Bev and Anna, uh, my coworkers and my friends. Bev, Anna, this is Barney, a high-functioning sociopath and my ex."
Barney,Enchant'. That's French for What's with the purple?,"Barney, this is Bev and Anna, uh, my coworkers and my friends. Bev, Anna, this is Barney, a high-functioning sociopath and my ex. Well, tomorrow is Valentine's Day, and everything is pink and red, so Bev very thoughtfully suggested that we wear purple to show how little we care."
Barney,Please! You might as well be dog-earing a tear-stained bridal magazine while wolfing down the box of chocolates you had delivered to yourself at work from your fianc' who no one's ever met.,"And we don't care about some stupid, sexist, corporate holiday.  Gerard is real!"
Barney,"Okay, when your fianc' Gerard comes back from fixing cleft palates in Peru, maybe snatch a photo of the two of you together, and then I'll totally believe you."," No!  Well, he's going to Kenya after Peru, so..."
Barney,My elbow slipped!,"Hey. Hey, Nora. Uh, Nora, this is Barney. You want to see Anna b*at him in an arm wrestle?  Marshall, I'm going home."
Barney,"So, you were an Olympic gymnast?", Please come home soon.  Silver medal.
Barney,"Ooh, sorry. Gold's the only thing that really counts.", Silver medal.  That's what my dad said.
Barney,"And she sticks the landing. Why don't you start stretching, and I'll... be right back. Hey, hey, sorry."," That's what my dad said.  Oh, hi."
Barney,Quick question.," Oh, hi.  Yeah."
Barney,Why aren't you wearing purple like your friends?," Yeah.  Oh, I told them I forgot, but the truth is, I'm kind of protesting their protest. Can you keep a secret?"
Barney,Sure.," Oh, I told them I forgot, but the truth is, I'm kind of protesting their protest. Can you keep a secret?  I love Valentine's Day."
Barney,"Oh, my gosh! Me, too! Um, is it getting crowded in here, 'cause I think there are two peas in this pod?"," I love Valentine's Day.  Oh, you're a gooey romantic, too?"
Barney,"Guilty. This is embarrassing but every year, I buy flowers and a box of chocolates, even if I'm not with someone. Just in case, you know?"," Oh, you're a gooey romantic, too?  We are pitiful."
Barney,The worst., We are pitiful.  Although there is one difference between you and me.
Barney,What's that?, Although there is one difference between you and me.  I'm not saying any of this to get in your pants.
Barney,"All right, okay. I was playing you before. But I was really doing you a public service. It's February 13... a day many are now calling Desperation Day. It's kind of a thing. And you walking around, saying you're a gooey romantic? It comes across a bit desperate."," Um, when I was a kid, we would spend the summers in the Upper Peninsula. And every year, we wouldn't get to the cabin till, like, the middle of the night. And so, it would be pitch black, in the middle of the woods. And I could never see anything in front of the headlights but I always felt so safe 'cause my dad was driving. He was like some sort of superhero who could just see way out into the darkness. Now he's just gone. And it's pitch black. And I can't see where I'm going. I can't see anything.  What's desperate about knowing what you want? Look, life is really short, Barney. Who wants to spend Valentine's Day alone, distracting yourself from the fact that nobody loves you with some sad little activity?"
Barney,"Um, or you could be in the 47th Semi-Annual Laser Tag Tournament in Poughkeepsie."," What's desperate about knowing what you want? Look, life is really short, Barney. Who wants to spend Valentine's Day alone, distracting yourself from the fact that nobody loves you with some sad little activity?  I have no idea what any of those words mean."
Barney,Here's the first thing you need to know about laser tag.," Hey, I'm all stretched out!  Thanks a lot for coming out here, man."
Barney,...became the 2010 Tri-County Champions.," Crusts cut off! No, Ted. What are we...? We're men. Mom! Leave the crusts on! They forced their opponents to scatter, picking them off, one by one, in a swift and merciless slaughter.  Wow. Laser tag sounds brilliant!"
Barney,"Oh, it is. Plus, if you win, you get free pizza. This is my teammate for tomorrow."," Wow. Laser tag sounds brilliant! Oh, yeah, I agreed to that."
Barney,"I'm telling you. The power of Valentine's Day. I'm Huey Lewis, and you just heard the news."," Look, Robin, you'll find someone, too. You're a queen. You've got so much to offer. Maybe do something with that hair.  Well, I think I'm heading out, too."
Barney,"What? No, don't go! You want to see a magic trick?!"," Well, I think I'm heading out, too.  It's late, and I have a date with my pillow. I mean, not literally. I'm not a lunatic. Boy Scout Troop 15 doesn't stand a chance. Bye."
Barney,What are you talking about?,"Speaking of the power of Valentine's Day... Oh, come on. It's-It's past midnight. Desperation Day has come and gone, and you have neither gone nor come. You know why? You like Nora."
Barney,"No, I don't. She's gross.","Oh, come on. It's-It's past midnight. Desperation Day has come and gone, and you have neither gone nor come. You know why? You like Nora. Oh... You like her. You think she smells like rain."
Barney,Whatever you say.,"Oh... You like her. You think she smells like rain. Oh, hey, Nora."
Barney,Nora...,"Oh, hey, Nora.  Here's a secret. I couldn't see worth a damn, either, buddy. I just kept driving forward, hoping for the best. Look out! Gotcha."
Barney,"The ground was shaking like. Robin, where are you? Those Boy Scouts have grown a foot since last year. They're terrifying!"," Well, that was kind of presumptuous. Oh, yeah. Change of plans. Happy Valentine's Day."
Barney,Hap...?,"Oh, yeah. Change of plans. Happy Valentine's Day.  Hey, Barney. Robin told me to meet you guys here."
Barney,Oh!," And that's how, for the first time in his life, Barney Stinson wound up on a date on Valentine's Day.  You will be avenged."
Barney, I don't know where you heard that. It was a disaster.," So, Barney, I hear you and Nora had a fun time at laser tag.  Not according to her."
Barney, You want to grab a drink right now?," Oh, my God, this was so much fun. We have to do this again. We do, we have to.  No, I'm kind of tired. But... this is my number. Give me a call."
Barney, Absolutely.," No, I'm kind of tired. But... this is my number. Give me a call.  How is that a disaster?"
Barney," She didn't want to get drinks. And as soon as a girl says she doesn't want to get drinks, well...", How is that a disaster?  You want to grab a drink right now?
Barney, You want to grab a drink right now?," She didn't want to get drinks. And as soon as a girl says she doesn't want to get drinks, well...  No, I'm kind of tired."
Barney, Absolutely.," No, I'm kind of tired.  It's a shame, too. She was a really great laser tag partner. She's tiny, so she's allowed to push kids."
Barney," It's a shame, too. She was a really great laser tag partner. She's tiny, so she's allowed to push kids."," Absolutely.  Please, Cheese. You like this girl."
Barney," What? Nora? No, I don't."," Please, Cheese. You like this girl.  Barney, you can't say her name without smiling."
Barney," That's... Nora. Sorry, sorry. I was thinking of a funny thing that Nora said. Hmm. Stop it. No... ra. Nah... Damn it, what is the matter with me?"," Barney, you can't say her name without smiling.  You like her. You should call her."
Barney," Call her? she had a nice face, her booty was in place, but Barney don't chase."," You like her. You should call her.  That is ridiculous. Barney, you know what, here's some advice."
Barney, Totally.," That is ridiculous. Barney, you know what, here's some advice.  Kids, I had just started dating Zoey. And when you first start dating someone, everyone wants to know the same thing. How did we meet?"
Barney, Like Prince.," Well, that's just what Minnesota guys are like... strong, silent, you know, man's man.  No, it's more than that. It's like, all the stuff he used to love, he suddenly has no interest in anymore."
Barney, Oh. Ha-wink," No, it's more than that. It's like, all the stuff he used to love, he suddenly has no interest in anymore.  Excuse me?"
Barney," Lily, in my travels, I've developed a finely calibrated sense of how long it's been since... How do I not put this delicately?... a girl's been porked. And, boo, you've been pork-free so long, you're practically kosher.", Excuse me?  It's been a while.
Barney," Five weeks, three days by my estimation.", It's been a while.  You should work at a carnival.
Barney, I tried. They're pretty strict with backgrounds.," You should work at a carnival.  Anyway, we should get going."
Barney,' weeks.," Good night. Good night, guys.  Damn it. Okay, yes, I am in a bit of a dry spell. But I just started a new job, and dating's been on the back burner, and..."
Barney," Shh. Child, listen. If you're really hurting for it, I'd be more than happy to throw you one."," Damn it. Okay, yes, I am in a bit of a dry spell. But I just started a new job, and dating's been on the back burner, and...  Throw me one? Yeah."
Barney, We're exes. We're probably due for a backslide. Or we could just do it the normal way.," Throw me one? Yeah.  Oh, I see what's going on."
Barney, Yeah?," Oh, I see what's going on.  This is about Nora. You met a girl, you liked her, but then you missed your sh*t. And now you're trying to hook up with your ex-girlfriend to prove to yourself that you don't care."
Barney," Robin, you could not be more... What do you mean I missed my sh*t?"," This is about Nora. You met a girl, you liked her, but then you missed your sh*t. And now you're trying to hook up with your ex-girlfriend to prove to yourself that you don't care.  Nora met a guy. What?!"
Barney, What?, Nora met a guy. What?!  Yep. Off the market. He's taking her to Cafe L'Amour this Friday night.
Barney," But L'Amour means love! They're going to the cafe of love! I'm fine. It's fine. Point is, Robin, I don't even like Nora. Damn it!"," Yep. Off the market. He's taking her to Cafe L'Amour this Friday night.  Oh, baby, why aren't you in bed?"
Barney," Dude, don't do that. All they're going to hear is $12 million, and all you're going to hear is the sound of the door smacking your fired ass. And some muffled laughter. Which I apologize for in advance."," You're welcome... Earth. Phase two: GNB. Tomorrow I'm going to make a presentation in front of the board about how we can cut our carbon footprint by half for only $12 million.  Guys, I got a problem. I ran into The Captain."
Barney," You lying little minx. I happened to be at Cafe L'Amour tonight from 5:00 p.m. until closing, reading a newspaper with two holes cut out of it, and I never saw Nora or this Italian race car driver she's dating.", Lily!  Sorry. Who said anything about an...?
Barney," Come on, you just know he's an Italian race car driver."," Sorry. Who said anything about an...?  No, he's not. He doesn't exist. I made the whole thing up to see if you like her. And you do. So you should just call her. Here is her number. And I also programmed it into your phone while you were in the bathroom. Wow. That was a joke. You just got here, remember? You really are smitten."
Barney," No, I'm not. I'm Barney Stinson. I don't get smitten, I smite!"," No, he's not. He doesn't exist. I made the whole thing up to see if you like her. And you do. So you should just call her. Here is her number. And I also programmed it into your phone while you were in the bathroom. Wow. That was a joke. You just got here, remember? You really are smitten.  You are totally smitten, but you're scared of being in a relationship."
Barney," No, I'm not. I can't be anyone's boyfriend, Robin. If I got serious with Nora, it would be like if Mother Teresa focused all her attention on one really hot orphan. With great penis comes great responsibility."," You are totally smitten, but you're scared of being in a relationship.  Okay, Mother Teresa, throw me one."
Barney, Sorry?," Okay, Mother Teresa, throw me one.  I would like it if you threw me one. Fastball, right down the middle. Actually, if I recall correctly, a slight curve."
Barney," Careful, Robin, I'll do it."," I would like it if you threw me one. Fastball, right down the middle. Actually, if I recall correctly, a slight curve.  Oh, I don't think you will. Hmm. Because you don't want to screw things up with Nora. Hey, prove me wrong. Tomorrow night, my place."
Barney," Don't poke the dragon, Robin, 'cause the dragon will poke you back."," Oh, I don't think you will. Hmm. Because you don't want to screw things up with Nora. Hey, prove me wrong. Tomorrow night, my place.  Sex now, we'll do the foreplay after."
Barney," All right, Robin, give it to me."," I hope this doesn't make me look desperate.  Damn it, Barney, you failed my test! You know, I- I try to root for you. Even as your ex-girlfriend, when you meet someone, I'm like, Yeah, Barney, go get her! But you know what? Just forget it. You're never gonna change. I'm done trying to help you."
Barney," The number. Give me the number, 'cause I really can't tell... Is that a seven or a nine?"," Damn it, Barney, you failed my test! You know, I- I try to root for you. Even as your ex-girlfriend, when you meet someone, I'm like, Yeah, Barney, go get her! But you know what? Just forget it. You're never gonna change. I'm done trying to help you.  It's a five, idiot."
Barney, A fi...? In what moon man language is that a five?," It's a five, idiot.  Moon man language? What does that even mean?"
Barney, How am I supposed to see that's a five?, Moon man language? What does that even mean?  Look how you taped this up...
Barney," Fine, fine, fine. I have a phone call to make.", Look how you taped this up...  Barney. Go get her.
Barney," I don't need to go to a heart doctor. I drink every day, I sleep three hours every night, and I have multiple sex partners. I'm doing everything right."," Kids, the heart is a mysterious muscle. You never really know what's going on in there. So after Uncle Marshall lost his father, he decided to get his heart checked. And so did I... and so did Lily... and so did Robin. And then Marshall went again, just to be sure. There was only one holdout.  Barney, come on, this is important. We need you around for a long time. Without you, we'd have to find some other sex-fueled, depraved animal to entertain us."
Barney," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Big Fudge. With? I am not with Nora. Wrong preposition. Later tonight I'm hoping to be on Nora, right? Or under Nora, right? Or, we're all adults, I'll just say it... behind Nora."," You're clearly trying to fill a hole... in her heart. You feel like the seventh wheel, because now Ted is with Zoey and Barney's with Nora and Lily's with Big Fudge. I don't know. This will be your second date."
Barney," Yeah. Penis feelings. Because she's hot. Guys, as you know, I only have one rule..."," Oh, Barney's got feeling for a girl.  Barney said this a lot."
Barney," If you're gonna get it on in a Port-O-Potty, do it early in the day [...] Never screw over a girl whose last name ends in a vowel. 'Cause she's got brothers [...] Never date a girl with a hook for a hand [...]", Barney said this a lot.  Never go out with the same girl more than once.
Barney, Never go out with the same girl more than once.," If you're gonna get it on in a Port-O-Potty, do it early in the day [...] Never screw over a girl whose last name ends in a vowel. 'Cause she's got brothers [...] Never date a girl with a hook for a hand [...]  Then why are you going out with Nora again?"
Barney, There is an exception., Then why are you going out with Nora again?  And it was always the same exception.
Barney,...unless she's hot [...]...unless she's hot [...]...unless she's hot.," And it was always the same exception.  And she is indeed hot. Which is why nothing, not even God himself... yeah, I said it, Beardy... is going to stand in the way of tonight being legend... Wait for it.(Hesneezes)"
Barney," And she is indeed hot. Which is why nothing, not even God himself... yeah, I said it, Beardy... is going to stand in the way of tonight being legend... Wait for it.(Hesneezes)","...unless she's hot [...]...unless she's hot [...]...unless she's hot.  Hey, Nora, sorry I'm late. I'm just, uh, just getting over a cold."
Barney," Hey, Nora, sorry I'm late. I'm just, uh, just getting over a cold."," And she is indeed hot. Which is why nothing, not even God himself... yeah, I said it, Beardy... is going to stand in the way of tonight being legend... Wait for it.(Hesneezes)  Oh, no. How long have you been sick?"
Barney, About 20 minutes. Can't seem to shake it.," Oh, no. How long have you been sick?  Okay, 'cause I was going to say you look a little..."
Barney, Handsome? Rich? Well-endowed?," Okay, 'cause I was going to say you look a little...  Huh, let's say well-endowed... with phlegm. All right, let's go. It's bedtime."
Barney, The bed... that's where all the...happens.," Huh, let's say well-endowed... with phlegm. All right, let's go. It's bedtime.  Come on, let's get you sorted out."
Barney, Ah. Thank you.," That night, Barney didn't take care of business. Instead, Nora took care of Barney.  Good night, Barney."
Barney," Good night, Mommy."," Good night, Barney.  Wow, she nursed you back to health?"
Barney, No. I didn't even see her boobs. She just took care of me.," Wow, she nursed you back to health? Oh, hey, guys. This is Nate. Nate, these are my friends."
Barney," Oh, oh, I should go. Lily, can I talk to you for a second? So, um, I made an appointment with that cardiologist."," Should have just let you get a dog.  Aw, and you want me to go with you 'cause you're a little scared?"
Barney, No.," Aw, and you want me to go with you 'cause you're a little scared?  Do you want me to go with you because you're a lot scared?"
Barney, Yes!," Do you want me to go with you because you're a lot scared?  Okay, fine. On one condition. You have to promise me you won't lie to Nora. She seems like something special."
Barney," Okay, I promise I won't lie to her. I may, however, lie on her. I said, bang-bang, bangity-bang.* Bang-bang-bang, bangity-bang *"," Okay, fine. On one condition. You have to promise me you won't lie to Nora. She seems like something special.  * Bang, bang, bangity bang... *"
Barney," * Bang, bang, bangity bang... *"," Okay, I promise I won't lie to her. I may, however, lie on her. I said, bang-bang, bangity-bang.* Bang-bang-bang, bangity-bang *  Are we done?"
Barney," * A bang-bang, bangity-bang. *"," Are we done?  Well, Barney, your heart sounds fine."
Barney," See, Lily? She was worried."," Well, Barney, your heart sounds fine.  Although it seems like you might have a slight arrhythmia."
Barney," Twen... Flag on the play, Doc. I have a date tonight."," It's probably nothing to worry about, but I'd like you to wear this heart monitor for the next 24 hours.  Don't worry. It's totally safe. Unless part of your big date involves connecting yourself to a car battery."
Barney," Well, now it doesn't."," Don't worry. It's totally safe. Unless part of your big date involves connecting yourself to a car battery.  And exactly 24 hours later, they returned for the results."
Barney," Go on, Doctor."," Okay, everything looks fine here, although I did notice a few irregularities. There's nothing to be...alarmed about.  What happened at 8:46 p.m. last night?"
Barney," Well, let's see... uh, Wheel of Fortune, naked push-ups, naked chin-ups... I was at dinner."," What happened at 8:46 p.m. last night?  This might be a little forward, but do you have a b*mb strapped to your chest?"
Barney," This? No, no. It's a heart monitor. It's a medical thing."," This might be a little forward, but do you have a b*mb strapped to your chest?  Oh, I'm so sorry. I've been trying not to stare at your chest all night."
Barney, What's that like?," Oh, I'm so sorry. I've been trying not to stare at your chest all night.  So is everything okay?"
Barney," My friend's dad passed away from a sudden heart att*ck. So I'm just getting myself checked out, too."," So is everything okay?  Oh, I am so sorry."
Barney, Thanks.," Oh, I am so sorry.  Um, Barney, what I'm about to say is going to sound a little weird, but I think I'm starting to like you, so I have to say it."
Barney," Well, for what it's worth, I'm not easily shocked. Unless you dump water on me, 'cause I'll just... No. What is it?"," Um, Barney, what I'm about to say is going to sound a little weird, but I think I'm starting to like you, so I have to say it.  I want to get married. I mean, not tonight, or even to you, necessarily. But that's what I want. And if that's going to scare you off, then I'd rather it scare you off now. I want a family, and I want to live in a little house with a garden and a tree for the kids to climb. And I want to go to sleep every night with the same person by my side, and wake up next to him in the morning every morning for the rest of our lives. Just thought you should know that."
Barney," That's exactly what I want, too."," You have to promise me you won't lie to Nora!  I'm really into gardening, but these squirrels keep messing with my tomatoes. Every time I see them in the backyard, I'm like, get out of here! And they run off, but sure enough, a few minutes later, there they are again. And I'm like, get out of here! So annoying. I smell food. Does this place have a kitchen? I'll be right back."
Barney," Hey, guys, this is Nora."," I'll get 'em.(Barney arrives, with Nora)  We were just passing by, and I wanted to pop in for two reasons. First, I wanted to let you know that your friend Barney is being a perfect gentleman."
Barney," I mean, I like being single, but secretly, I want to have kids."," Oh, you should have heard him at dinner.  How many do you want?"
Barney, Three... one of each. You?, How many do you want?  Three. All in an old stone house.
Barney," Yeah, with ivy growing on it.", Three. All in an old stone house.  And we must have a pool.
Barney, And we must have a pool.," Yeah, with ivy growing on it.  We? A pool sounds brilliant. Are you for real, Barney?"
Barney, I really am.," We? A pool sounds brilliant. Are you for real, Barney?  Unbelievable."
Barney," I assure you, that's not a nickname that I..."," I know, right? And the second reason we popped in is 'cause I need to use the loo. But when I get back, I'm dying to hear all about Mr. Softy here.  And that explains your 14-second cardiac arrest."
Barney," I'm not lying! Guys, Nora's really special. In fact... I think I'm... falling in love with her. Guys! I'm serious."," Barney, you promised you wouldn't lie.  I'm not going to let you do this. When Nora gets back here, I'm bl*wing the whistle."
Barney," Guys, this is real. And if you don't make me look good in front of Nora, just remember: I've got dirt on each of you, and I am not afraid to spill it."," Just make sure it's not a high-frequency whistle, because we don't want to t*rture Robin's boyfriend.  Barney, you can't blackmail us into lying to Nora."
Barney," Really, Lily? Even if I were to mention, oh, I don't know... your kindergarten class's pet guinea pig?"," Barney, you can't blackmail us into lying to Nora.  Mr. Buttons? Oh, you son of a bitch. Fine. I'll be nice."
Barney, Marshall?," Mr. Buttons? Oh, you son of a bitch. Fine. I'll be nice.  You got nothing on me."
Barney, The calzone?, You got nothing on me.  Checkmate.
Barney, Robin.," Checkmate. Don't say the Mr. T dream, don't say the Mr. T dream, don't say the Mr. T dream..."
Barney, The Mr. T dream...,"Don't say the Mr. T dream, don't say the Mr. T dream, don't say the Mr. T dream...  I'm lost."
Barney, Ted?, I'm lost.  Go ahead. Give me your best. My life's an open book.
Barney, The ballet class., Go ahead. Give me your best. My life's an open book.  I once took a ballet class. Not ashamed.
Barney, The 'N Sync concert.," I once took a ballet class. Not ashamed. '98. Cleveland's g*n Arena, front row. Caught JC's shirt. What else you got?"
Barney," Okay, Ted. The thermos.","'98. Cleveland's g*n Arena, front row. Caught JC's shirt. What else you got?  I suppose it's possible Barney has real feelings for Nora."
Barney, I do! So be cool!, I suppose it's possible Barney has real feelings for Nora.  There's a man back there who seems fascinated by the records flipping in the jukebox.
Barney, Thermos., Once?  Nope. Not even once.
Barney," I only have one rule. Never, ever, ever meet a girl's parents.", This was a big deal for Barney.  Not even if she's hot?
Barney, Not even if her mom's hot., Not even if she's hot?  I'd love to meet your parents.
Barney, I'd love to meet your parents.," Not even if her mom's hot.  It's a date. Well, we should get going. Walk me home?"
Barney," No, Scooby, you, uh... stay!"," Walk? Somebody say walk? I'll go for a walk. I love a good walk. Oh, no. I got called back in to work. Can you keep an eye on him until I get back? He's new to the city, and he doesn't really know anyone."
Barney," Yeah, me, too.", Here we are. I had a really great time tonight.  Do you want to come upstairs?
Barney," I'd love to.(He kisses her)There's just one little thing, and it probably doesn't matter, but... I don't want to get married. I've been saying that all night just to get in your pants.", Do you want to come upstairs?  Can you believe...
Barney, Can you believe...," I'd love to.(He kisses her)There's just one little thing, and it probably doesn't matter, but... I don't want to get married. I've been saying that all night just to get in your pants.  Oh, my God! I found Scooby's wallet."
Barney," Wait... Nora, wait. Wait. I'm sorry I misled you.", Wait wait! Robin. Can you pick up some calzones?  Misled? You lied to me! You had your friends lie to me!
Barney, I was on the spot. This is your fault., Misled? You lied to me! You had your friends lie to me!  My fault?
Barney," Yeah, with the whole I want to get married thing. You can't just tell someone exactly what you want out of a relationship. This... isn't England."," My fault?  Good-bye, Barney."
Barney," Uh, yeah. Isn't that him taking a leak on that f*re hydrant?","Hey, have you seen Scooby?  Scooby!"
Barney," Okay. Lily, I'm sorry that I lied about wanting to settle down."," Day's not over.  No, that wasn't the lie. The lie was when you told Nora you were lying. Because you weren't. You want that stuff, Barney, I know you do."
Barney," Okay. Maybe, eventually, I could settle down. 50 years from now, if I have like a Hefner thing going on with some really hot twins. But those twins won't even be born for another... 32 years. I mean... Nora's great. She's wonderful. But..."," No, that wasn't the lie. The lie was when you told Nora you were lying. Because you weren't. You want that stuff, Barney, I know you do.  What time was your dinner reservation?"
Barney, Last night? 8:30., What time was your dinner reservation?  What did his heart do at 8:30? It... literally skipped a b*at.
Barney, I lied.," Your heart's talking to you, Barney. Do you have the guts to listen to it.  Barney."
Barney," When I said I lied, that was a lie, and I'm sorry.", Barney.  I'm confused.
Barney," So am I. This, all of this, this is totally new to me, but I know it's what I want. I want to be confused. With you."," I'm confused.  Mom, Dad... this is Barney."
Barney," Hi. I'm Barney. Great to meet you. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?"," Mom, Dad... this is Barney."
Barney," Ted. This is your seduction lounge. Sex swing there, vibrating Jell-O pit right there, rotating Vietnamese Shame Wheel right here. Don't ask; you're not ready. And that basketball hoop? Outdoor stripper pole. We'll just tell the ladies to be careful in the winter. You think a tongue stuck to a frozen pole is bad..."," Vintage rolltop desk here. I haven't decided whether to put the fern on the right or the left side, but you know, sometimes you just gotta wing it. Right? Left side. Oh, and right outside, I want to put up a basketball hoop for the kids.  Hey. Barney, let's go outside for a second."
Barney," Oh, thank God. I'll go first. Ted, this hous you bought for your hypothetical family is super weird. We talk about it all the time behind your back.",We have a confession. This wasn't really about seeing Ted's house. It's an intervention.  Yeah. This intervention isn't for me. It's for you
Barney," Sure thing. Luis. Barney Stinson, 12 H. I got a hundred bucks if you can be here in five. Thanks."," Okay, uh, I think I see what the problem is. Barney, can you grab me a screwdriver? You call the super for a screwdriver?"
Barney," Yeah... here's the thing about me and tools... the only one I know how to use is attached to me, and I am not going to try putting it in the TV. Again.","You call the super for a screwdriver?  Okay, that's ridiculous. Everyone should know how to use tools."
Barney," Well, here's our screwdriver now. (Barney opens the door, then whispers loudly:)Guys, I'm pretty sure that's not Luis, but I can't be certain. Someone introduce yourself."," Okay, that's ridiculous. Everyone should know how to use tools.  Barney, I... I got your letter."
Barney, Dad?," Barney, I... I got your letter.  I can't believe Barney is talking to his dad right now."
Barney, Where do I begin?," Hey. Tell us everything. How'd it go, bud?  So, I'm not sure how to start this."
Barney," So, I'm not sure how to start this.", Where do I begin?  Yeah. I think I need a drink.
Barney, Yeah. I think I need a drink.," So, I'm not sure how to start this.  Me, too."
Barney," Look, it's been 30 years. And now you just show up out of nowhere? This is... this is going to take me a minute."," Nice order. Up top.  Yeah. I understand. By the way, hell of a tie. Is that Italian silk?"
Barney," I love you, Daddy. I'm so glad we're best friends now."," Yeah. I understand. By the way, hell of a tie. Is that Italian silk?  Make a muscle."
Barney, Make a muscle.," I love you, Daddy. I'm so glad we're best friends now.  There you go."
Barney, Ah!," There you go.  Guys, my dad's awesome. He's the mother of all fathers. Check this out."
Barney," Guys, my dad's awesome. He's the mother of all fathers. Check this out."," Ah!  Hey, back when I was a kid, you used to be a roadie. Do you still do that?"
Barney," Hey, back when I was a kid, you used to be a roadie. Do you still do that?"," Guys, my dad's awesome. He's the mother of all fathers. Check this out.  Not anymore. Back in '83 I'm lugging amps for The Stones through West Germany, and their tour manager loses his arms, bus-surfing through a tunnel. Gnarly. Long story short, I've been managing tours ever since, and that dude high-fives people with his face now."
Barney, You're funny. My dad's funny.," Not anymore. Back in '83 I'm lugging amps for The Stones through West Germany, and their tour manager loses his arms, bus-surfing through a tunnel. Gnarly. Long story short, I've been managing tours ever since, and that dude high-fives people with his face now.  So, all these years, there's this one question I've been dying to ask him."
Barney," So, all these years, there's this one question I've been dying to ask him.", You're funny. My dad's funny. Why did you abandon me?
Barney, Do you... get laid a lot?," You've hurt me before, why should I trust you now?  Big-time. Observe."
Barney," Oh, my God, that took you five seconds."," Big-time. Observe.  Oh, was it that long? Life's too short for chatty chicks."
Barney, You're a master. You are legen... wait for it...," Oh, was it that long? Life's too short for chatty chicks. ...daddy! Legendaddy! The man is a god. And he's still out there, living the dream."
Barney,"...daddy! Legendaddy! The man is a god. And he's still out there, living the dream.", You're a master. You are legen... wait for it...  So I'm going to Sydney tomorrow with Bon Jovi. I'll be on the road the rest of the year.
Barney," Oh, that's cool."," So I'm going to Sydney tomorrow with Bon Jovi. I'll be on the road the rest of the year.  Say, you want to join me for the tour's Asian leg?"
Barney, This is going to be the second-most fun I've ever had on an Asian leg. (both laughing)," Say, you want to join me for the tour's Asian leg? Barney, we... we know you're psyched, but just... be careful."
Barney, What do you mean?,"Barney, we... we know you're psyched, but just... be careful.  Well, this guy has flaked out on your whole life. It sounds like he just might be telling you what you want to hear."
Barney," First of all, Robin, my dad could b*at up your dad. Second, you don't have to worry. He's cool. Now if you'll excuse me... I have to go renew my passport, and get a travel-sized rotating Vietnamese Shame Wheel. Don't ask; you're not ready."," Barney, we just don't want to see you get hurt.  I hope Barney's dad isn't just pretending to be something he's not, you know?"
Barney, I'm not sure how to start this., That's not what happened.  Yeah.
Barney, I think I need a drink.," Yeah.  Me, too."
Barney," Glen McKenna, neat."," Me, too.  Milk, skim."
Barney," Milk? Oh, you're taking it easy. Crazy night?"," Milk, skim.  I'll say. Between you and me, I had a lot of acid last night."
Barney, Wow.," I'll say. Between you and me, I had a lot of acid last night.  I think it was the chili dog. I had to take four Tums. I was up till, like, 9:30."
Barney," Hey, um.. When I was a kid, you used to be a roadie. You still do that?"," I think it was the chili dog. I had to take four Tums. I was up till, like, 9:30.  No. I switched lanes years ago. I should explain. I'm a driving instructor. Now you get it, right"
Barney," Yeah, no, I get it. Um, but when I was a kid, you... you were this total badass."," No. I switched lanes years ago. I should explain. I'm a driving instructor. Now you get it, right  Oh, I know. I was a real hard partier."
Barney," Yeah, okay, now we're getting to the good stuff."," Oh, I know. I was a real hard partier.  The drugs, the alcohol, the women..."
Barney," Yes, yes, yes."," The drugs, the alcohol, the women...  I was out of control."
Barney, *Out of control.*," I was out of control.  So when your mom said I couldn't see you any more, it was rock bottom for me. I'm so sorry."
Barney, You ever bang Stevie Nicks?," So when your mom said I couldn't see you any more, it was rock bottom for me. I'm so sorry.  Barney wasn't interested in my apology. He just wanted me to be cool. And I was so desperate to connect with him. I did something I'm not proud of. I started bragging."
Barney, Big-time.," What a hottie, huh? I'm sure you're a real player.  Observe. Excuse me, that's my son over there. I'm trying to reconnect with him after 30 years. Would you just write down any seven numbers here, so that I can impress him? Please, I'm desperate."
Barney," Oh, my God, you're a natural. Think of the pickup plays we can run as a father-son duo. There's the Father Knows Breast, there's the Bush Dynasty, the Lick Father, Lick Son."," Observe. Excuse me, that's my son over there. I'm trying to reconnect with him after 30 years. Would you just write down any seven numbers here, so that I can impress him? Please, I'm desperate.  Oh, no, no. I couldn't do that."
Barney, Why?," Oh, no, no. I couldn't do that.  I have a family now. That's my wife Cheryl, my daughter Carly... she's in college. This is my son J.J. I was hoping you could come over to dinner sometime and meet them."
Barney," You're all wearing matching sweaters. That's cute. Look, I got to get going, Jerry. But, uh, this was great. Glad we did this."," I have a family now. That's my wife Cheryl, my daughter Carly... she's in college. This is my son J.J. I was hoping you could come over to dinner sometime and meet them.  I made him wait all these years for me and... I'm just not the guy he wanted me to be. I know I don't deserve it, but... I need another chance to connect with my son.Back to the intervention at Ted's house..."
Barney, What?,We think you should give him another chance. That's the real reason we're out here. He lives ten minutes away.  You're having dinner with him tonight.
Barney," No, I most certainly am not. Look, I met him. He's not my kind of bro and that's that.", You're having dinner with him tonight.  Are you sure it's not more than that?
Barney," Guys, get it through your heads. I am never gonna talk to my dad again."," Are you sure it's not more than that?  No, Barney. I'm never gonna talk to my dad again. But your dad is alive and he lives just down the road."
Barney," Fine, I'll go."," No, Barney. I'm never gonna talk to my dad again. But your dad is alive and he lives just down the road.  Awesome. Um, Lily, keys.(She throws them way too hard, they land in the trees)I'm literally 11 inches from you."
Barney," Oh, thank you very much. And I love your...coat. I love your coat."," Hello. You must be Barney. I'm Cheryl. It's just so nice to finally meet you. I love that suit.  Oh, that's your coat, Barney. I just took it from you."
Barney," Well, I do love it. It's doing a nice job covering up that chair."," Oh, that's your coat, Barney. I just took it from you. Guess now we wait."
Barney," It ages well, that's the thing."," Hey, Lily, (his voice cracks) Can you get me a mojito? Normally, you would've given me crap for an hour about a voice crack that pubescently girl-like, but nothing. So then I started to test you guys. [...] The Phantom Menace is by far the best Star Wars movie.  You guys like my new soul patch?"
Barney, I do remember that. I climbed up on that dude's lap and told him what I wanted for Christmas.," J.J., dinner. When I got your letter, I dug this up. You were probably too young to remember, but this is you, this is me, and, of course, ZZ Top.  Yeah, I used to love taking you backstage. You were the coolest little kid."
Barney," J.J., I'm talking to Dad right now. God."," Hi, Barney. It's great to finally meet you.  Seriously, it's time. What are my gaps?"
Barney," Yeah, I do. I make a ton of money. How much do you make, J.J.?"," So, Barney, I understand you have a pretty big job with a bank.  I'm 11."
Barney," Oh, well, huh, now we all know you make excuses. I was talking about money."," I'm 11.  Actually, J.J. has a job. Tell him, J.J."
Barney," Good time to get into print media. Am I right, Dad?"," I got a paper route.  Good slam, Barney."
Barney," Uh, you don't strike me as the athletic type, Jayj. Dad, check it. Triceps. What gym do you go to?", J.J.'s a heck of a basketball player.  Fourth period?
Barney," Sounds like you're having your fourth period. Am I right, Dad?!", Fourth period?  Got him again.
Barney, Why? J.J. started it. What does J.J. even stand for anyway? J... Jerky... Jerkface?," Oh, okay, Barney. Uh, maybe that's enough.  J.J. stands for Jerome Jr."
Barney, Jerome Jr...? Oh. He's... he's named after you. Excuse me., J.J. stands for Jerome Jr.  I like having a brother.
Barney, This is mine.," Barney, what is going on?  I don't understand."
Barney," J.J. gets a childhood, a dad, a real family and a basketball hoop? No, no. I at least get the hoop. I'm taking it with me."," I don't understand.  Please, just come down and talk to me."
Barney," Why? Why should I? You're lame, okay? You're just some lame suburban dad."," Please, just come down and talk to me.  Why does that make you so mad?"
Barney," Because if you were gonna be some lame suburban dad, why couldn't you have been that for me?!"," Why does that make you so mad?  Look, Barney, I know I screwed up..."
Barney," Oh, screwed up doesn't even begin to describe..."," Look, Barney, I know I screwed up...  I know, I know, I know! I want to fix this, and I don't know how! Please, tell me what I can do! I'll do anything! You're never gonna get it down like that. Barney. Barney! Just put the pointy end into the grooves. That's it. Now turn it. Righty tighty, lefty loosey. I have no good excuse, Barney. It took me years before I was even able to look myself in the mirror for the way I let you down. It took courage to send me that letter. More courage than I've ever had. I owe you a lifetime of apologies, and I... I just have no idea where to begin."
Barney, Can you help me with this?," I know, I know, I know! I want to fix this, and I don't know how! Please, tell me what I can do! I'll do anything! You're never gonna get it down like that. Barney. Barney! Just put the pointy end into the grooves. That's it. Now turn it. Righty tighty, lefty loosey. I have no good excuse, Barney. It took me years before I was even able to look myself in the mirror for the way I let you down. It took courage to send me that letter. More courage than I've ever had. I owe you a lifetime of apologies, and I... I just have no idea where to begin.  Here, got it. Look, if you... ever feel like you're ready, I'd love nothing more than to be a part of your life."
Barney, Bye.," Here, got it. Look, if you... ever feel like you're ready, I'd love nothing more than to be a part of your life. Are you sure you don't want to talk about it?"
Barney," I'm fine. Hey, Ted.","Are you sure you don't want to talk about it?  Yeah, buddy."
Barney," You, uh, still want a basketball hoop out there?"," Yeah, buddy.  Oh, well, I also really liked your outdoor stripper pole idea. Yeah, it's fine."
Barney," No, you were right. A kid needs a hoop."," Oh, well, I also really liked your outdoor stripper pole idea. Yeah, it's fine."
Barney," Ted, why are you dating our arch-enemy?! I mean, Wile E. Coyote wasn't trying to sleep with the Roadrunner."," But somehow, Zoey and I were making it work.  Or maybe he was. Think about it. The way that she bats her eyelashes and shakes her tail feathers in his face? (chuckles) She wants it."
Barney, Quit GNB?! Why?," I have to quit.  I need to do better things with my life, okay? There's-There's an opening for an environmental lawyer at the National Resources Defense Council. Sure, it pays less, but I'd be saving the oceans, saving endangered species..."
Barney," Saving chicken bones and an old boot to make hobo soup? Marshall, you can't pay your mortgage with Hacky Sacks and good vibes."," I need to do better things with my life, okay? There's-There's an opening for an environmental lawyer at the National Resources Defense Council. Sure, it pays less, but I'd be saving the oceans, saving endangered species...  Baby, you have my full support."
Barney," Well, then, you're not going to be able to pay for that trip to Spain that you've been planning. (Barney snickers) Say good-bye to riding around in gondolas, and eating bratwurst and seeing the pyramids."," Baby, you have my full support. I don't think you know what Spain is."
Barney," Well, I know that a trip there costs some serious lira.",I don't think you know what Spain is.  It's dinero.
Barney, Where? I want his autograph!," It's dinero.  So Marshall walked in the next morning all ready to quit. But then something weird happened. Suddenly, he didn't hate the paperwork. He didn't hate the coffee. He didn't even hate the dirty jokes. Out of nowhere, Marshall actually liked GNB."
Barney," Yeah. I've been there, too. Every time I'm done having sex with a woman, at first,I never want to see her again. No, that's pretty much it.","He was the worst kisser I've ever been with. But the moment I decided to dump him...I suddenly got kind of wistful. (as speaking to a dog): He was a good boy. The point is, you can't trust graduation goggles. They're just as misleading as beer goggles, bridesmaid goggles, and that's-just-a-bulky, outdated-cell-phone in-his-front-pocket goggles. That one was a bummer."
Barney," No! You can't quit tomorrow! The lady with the big nipples is coming back to give another sexual harassment seminar, and I bribed one of the maintenance guys to keep the room at a brisk 55 degrees!"," You're right. Tomorrow, I'm quitting GNB.  Baby, more than ever, you have my full support.(Lily and Marshall kisses)"
Barney, It starts with an... L?, I'm starting to feel bad for Ted and Zoey.  How can you not remember my name?
Barney, And I said my name was...?," It rhymes with your name.  Baby, I did it! I quit. And then I walked right over to the NRDC, and I took that job."
Barney," It's always the one in the turtleneck, Ted. And no, I don't want to play. Stupid Marshall-... ruined everything."," Hey, Barney, there's a bunch of models in the lobby, and the gossip is one of them is really a dude. You want to play Who's Hot and Who's Scott?  Oh, come on. Everything's not ruined."
Barney, I'm sorry. Sorry. Something Hershel said at work today.," Hey, guys. Thanks. Hey. I just had the best first day at the NRDC.  Hershel?"
Barney," What, don't you guys know Hershel? Didn't I tell you? Oh, he's the new lawyer who replaced Marshall at GNB. He is so awesome and funny and tall... taller than Marshall... and he knows way more laws."," Hershel?  Well, I'm glad you like your new co-worker."
Barney, There's no Hershel! I was just saying that to make you jealous! Why do you insist we play these games?," Well, I'm glad you like your new co-worker.  Barney, I'm not playing..."
Barney, Just come back to GNB already!," Barney, I'm not playing...  I'm really loving my new job."
Barney, That's how I'm gonna use mine.," Thanks, baby. (phone chirps)Oh. Ooh, I gotta go. The invitations are ready. The party's for a bunch of environmentalists, so I found a guy downtown who makes biodegradable party invitations that can also be used as toilet paper.  Why in the world do you care so much whether Marshall works at GNB?"
Barney," Care? I don't care. I'm like, whatever. Marshall who? He's stupid. Hershel's way better."," Why in the world do you care so much whether Marshall works at GNB? Okay, Barney, is it possible that with everything that's gone on with your dad lately, you might have some unresolved abandonment issues you're transferring onto Marshall?"
Barney," Oh! Ugh! You are worse than my shrink. Barney, we have to talk about your father. Barney, I'm not going to teach you how to hypnotize people. You'll only use it for evil. Barney, I am not going to conduct a couples session between you and this woman. She's obviously a prost*tute. I don't need this!At Ted's appartment","Okay, Barney, is it possible that with everything that's gone on with your dad lately, you might have some unresolved abandonment issues you're transferring onto Marshall?  Ah, Lily Aldrin, half of the world's most perfect couple! I was thinking about that woman's mouth comment, and I have three good comebacks. One: your mom didn't seem to mind it last night on her..."
Barney," Hey, Marshall, it's me. Listen, I know I've been kind of a jerk about your leaving GNB. I just wanted to call and say I'm sorry. No apologies necessary. We're good. Good. Um, hey, any chance you might maybe... I don't know... if you're not busy, uh, want to have lunch today?"," Okay, look, Ted, I need a favor. Would you mind driving out to Kennedy with me to pick up this famous ecologist for Marshall's fund-raiser? Apparently, he only speaks Spanish. And you speak Spanish, right?(Ted says something in spanish)Perfect. Let's go.  Oh, buddy, I'd love to, but I can't."
Barney," Oh, that's cool. No biggie. Another time."," Oh, buddy, I'd love to, but I can't. (Robin is standing at the door)Oh, my God!"
Barney, How long have you been there?,"(Robin is standing at the door)Oh, my God!  You don't remember?"
Barney," Oh, no, I'm fine."," Hey. I was in the neighborhood. I just wanted to check in on you. You seemed, um, you seemed really upset the other day.  Okay. Well, um, you want to go grab some lunch?"
Barney,"Sure. Hey, are you okay if I invite Marshall to join us?"," Okay. Well, um, you want to go grab some lunch?  Yeah."
Barney,"Right. So, um... Chinese?"," Yeah.  You know, just because Zoey and I are a different kind of couple than you and Marshall doesn't make us a worse couple."
Barney, There's nothing to talk about.," My bag? Oh, no. I got it.  You trashed your office today. I mean, you obviously have some deep feelings you're not confronting. And I think they're about your dad."
Barney," I don't want to talk about it, okay?"," You trashed your office today. I mean, you obviously have some deep feelings you're not confronting. And I think they're about your dad.  Why not?"
Barney, Because I don't. And why am I explaining this to you? You're the most secretive person I know. You never tell anybody anything.," Why not?  I've never... told anyone this before. Um... I was 16. I was awakened around midnight by the sound of my father arguing with his business partner, Andy Grenier. As things grew heated... I watched my father's hand slowly coil around the heavy antique clock on his desk. The sun was just starting to rise over the bramble orchard as we packed the fresh earth down with the flats of our shovels. My dad and I got our stories straight. We walked back to the house in silence and... haven't talked about it since. But sometimes... on a still night... you can still hear that clock, ticking... ticking... (quietly): ticking."
Barney, That's... the most harrowing story I've ever heard. Is it true?," I've never... told anyone this before. Um... I was 16. I was awakened around midnight by the sound of my father arguing with his business partner, Andy Grenier. As things grew heated...

No. But it did get you to drink three scotches, which is why you're ready to spill your guts."
Barney, Fine! The reason I'm upset about Marshall leaving GNB is... is...the meatball sub.," No. But it did get you to drink three scotches, which is why you're ready to spill your guts.  Huh?"
Barney, It all started months ago in the GNB commissary. It was Meatball Sub Day.," Huh?  Oh, how I used to love Meatball Sub Day. And then, the most humiliating moment of my life."
Barney," Oh, how I used to love Meatball Sub Day. And then, the most humiliating moment of my life."," It all started months ago in the GNB commissary. It was Meatball Sub Day.  Hey, buddy, I think you got a tiny little bit of marinara sauce on your tie there."
Barney," I plotted my revenge for weeks. But nothing seemed right. Then it h*t me. The answer was so elegant and simple-- an exploding meatball sub. For months, I experimented. More... marinara sauce. Finally, the sub was perfected. The plan was in place. The snare was baited. And then..."," Hey, buddy, I think you got a tiny little bit of marinara sauce on your tie there. ...he quit, Robin, he quit! It's Meatball Sub Day today, which is why I wanted Marshall to come over and have lunch. But no. All that work wasted. (quiet sobbing) You want to make God laugh, tell him your plans, right?"
Barney,"...he quit, Robin, he quit! It's Meatball Sub Day today, which is why I wanted Marshall to come over and have lunch. But no. All that work wasted.

And then...  What is wrong with you?"
Barney," Thank you, Marshall. (coughs weakly) Marshall... can I ask one final favor, my friend?"," We're not going anywhere, buddy. We're gonna stay here right till the end.  Yes, of course, of course... anything."
Barney, Eat this meatball sub.," Yes, of course, of course... anything.  Wh-Where'd you get a meatball..."
Barney, I don't have much time!," Wh-Where'd you get a meatball...  Okay, yes, yes, of course. Of course. Does this have some sort of special meaning?"
Barney," I'm not sick, you idiots! I've racked up $30,000 of uninsured medical bills for symptoms I don't even have. Totally worth it! You should see the look on your face. Oh, wait, you can't-- 'cause it's covered in marinara sauce!"," Okay, yes, yes, of course. Of course. Does this have some sort of special meaning?  Uh, Barney, you got a little marinara on your pajamas."
Barney, What? That's... What is that word you taught me? Bull something?," Barney, afraid this is good-bye. Your buzz k*ll of a ma... thinks I'm a... a bad influence on you.  But she's your mother and I'm... you know, I'm just your Uncle Jerry. So, this is the last time I can see you."
Barney, But you're supposed to take me to see that Zeppelin cover band next week. The night is gonna be... Led-and-Jerry.," But she's your mother and I'm... you know, I'm just your Uncle Jerry. So, this is the last time I can see you.  Sorry, buddy, but this is it. But don't you forget your training. What's a magician's best friend?"
Barney, A drunk audience.," Sorry, buddy, but this is it. But don't you forget your training. What's a magician's best friend?  Attaboy. You still got that button from the festival we went to? Now... I'm gonna put this right inside your brain, behind your ear... so that I'll know that you won't forget me. See you, buddy. And hey... Never... stop... partying."
Barney, Bye.," This time it was Barney who did the walking.  And that was almost the end of it. Except, a few weeks later..."
Barney," I am so angry at my dad! Guess who called me today. Go on, guess."," And that was almost the end of it. Except, a few weeks later...  Mmm. Your dad?"
Barney, My dad!, Mmm. Your dad?  Barney Stinson.
Barney, Barney Stinson.," My dad!  Hi, Barney. It's your dad. Look, would you like to go fishing with me and J.J. on Sunday morning?"
Barney," Ooh, hold on, let me check my personality. Oh, no. Turns out I would never do that in a million years."," Hi, Barney. It's your dad. Look, would you like to go fishing with me and J.J. on Sunday morning?  Barney, look... I know you're disappointed that your dad is just... a boring old driving instructor from the suburbs. But that guy I used to be... Crazy Jerry? He was bad news! Drinking, partying, sleeping around. The party can't go on forever. You're 35; I'm-I'm sure you're starting to realize that, right?"
Barney, You do not know how right you are.," Barney, look... I know you're disappointed that your dad is just... a boring old driving instructor from the suburbs. But that guy I used to be... Crazy Jerry? He was bad news! Drinking, partying, sleeping around. The party can't go on forever. You're 35; I'm-I'm sure you're starting to realize that, right?  Zero right! We're not getting too old for anything."
Barney, Zero right! We're not getting too old for anything.," You do not know how right you are.  You sure? I feel like we collectively learn the opposite lesson, like, at least once a year."
Barney," I have to face an ugly truth. Jerry Whittaker, my own father, is anti-awesome-etic. I know Crazy Jerry's still in there somewhere, but he's trapped under 20 years of lawnmower parties and carpool barbecues."," You sure? I feel like we collectively learn the opposite lesson, like, at least once a year.  Wow, you know nothing about the suburbs."
Barney,"Well, this Saturday night, I am bustin' him out. I'm gonna make Jerry realize he was wrong about giving up his old life by showing him the awesomest night of all time. And for the awesomest night of all time, I'm going to need the awesomest friends of all time. Okay, who do I know? Guys...! Do any of you know George Clooney?"," Wow, you know nothing about the suburbs.  Okay, my dad's almost here. I need everything to be as awesome as possible tonight."
Barney," Okay, my dad's almost here. I need everything to be as awesome as possible tonight.","Well, this Saturday night, I am bustin' him out. I'm gonna make Jerry realize he was wrong about giving up his old life by showing him the awesomest night of all time. And for the awesomest night of all time, I'm going to need the awesomest friends of all time. Okay, who do I know? Guys...! Do any of you know George Clooney?  That's why you brought these guys."
Barney,No. That's why I brought these guys.(He gets several cards out of his inside pocket)I've made some minor improvements to your identities. Uh. Mm! You'll find them on these cards., That's why you brought these guys.  Improvements?!
Barney,Yeah.," Improvements?!  Bro, we are already the four jiggity-jamminest dudes and dudettes this side of... Okay, let's see the cards."
Barney,"Robin, no one watches the news unless it's a car chase or a nip slip. You are now a professional scotch taster. Lily, Jerry needs to learn that other lifestyles are just as fulfilling as monogamy, so now you and Marshall are in an open marriage."," Bro, we are already the four jiggity-jamminest dudes and dudettes this side of... Okay, let's see the cards.  Whoo-hoo!"
Barney,"Also, Marshall, you can't just be unemployed, so you are now a gin-swilling, womanizing playwright. And, Ted, just be yourself. (chuckles) Just kidding. Here's a giant pile of topics you should avoid talking about."," Gross!  Well. Well, this could actually be fun. In fact, I believe it was Oscar Wilde who said, Man is least himself when he talks..."
Barney,"Ted, card."," Well. Well, this could actually be fun. In fact, I believe it was Oscar Wilde who said, Man is least himself when he talks...  Ah. You're right... No quoting Oscar Wilde."
Barney,"Finally... Robin, you're dating Ted."," Ah. You're right... No quoting Oscar Wilde.  Aw, man! Why?"
Barney," I can't have any single female friends lying around. My dad'll be all, Why don't you marry Robin? You guys are cute together. Deep down, you know you were never happier than when you were with her. Uh... (chuckles) no, thanks."," Aw, man! Why?  Hey, Barney... love the new identities. Little thing... instead of being a naked super ninja, can I be Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada?"
Barney, And... hence new identities., How good was that movie?  And so Barney's dad finally showed up.
Barney," Jerry, you remember Marshall... he's a well-known writer."," And so Barney's dad finally showed up.  Playwright. We're all writers, just some of us don't know what our story is yet."
Barney," Lily, his wife."," Playwright. We're all writers, just some of us don't know what our story is yet.  Well, most nights. Mama don't let no ring get in the way of a good time."
Barney," Wait, wait. Jerry, I got to tell you the truth. Guys, I'm gonna tell him. We're also a band."," Robin. Hi. So nice to see you again.  Two, three, four!"
Barney," Oh, we're not drinking here. Tonight we're going big. Let's see, what club should we h*t first? There's Club Was, there's Wrong..."," So, Saturday night... time to cut loose, right? Who wants to split a beer?  Um, those places shut down a long time ago."
Barney," Oh, no."," Um, those places shut down a long time ago.  Oh, No shut down, too."
Barney," No, Was wasn't where Where was, Was was where Wrong was, right?"," Where's where Was was, isn't it?  Okay."
Barney," Guys, focus."," That's wrong. That's not Wrong.  Oh, I like Focus. Let's go there."
Barney," No, Was was Closed. Once Was shut down, it reopened as Closed.", I thought Focus was closed.  So Closed is open.
Barney," No, Shut up shut down. I can't believe I don't know the clubs anymore."," Guys, shut up.  Guys, just pick a club, okay?"
Barney," It's hopeless, isn't it?"," For the record, I was in there once by accident. I'm pretty sure it's pronounced Lam'.  Wow. A lot of these girls are young enough to be our daughters."
Barney, I know. Daddy's home. And Granddaddy's home! Tonight rocks so hard!, Wow. A lot of these girls are young enough to be our daughters.  I might be allergic to this stamp.
Barney," Man, isn't this place great?"," You owe me one.  Uh, I don't know. It's so loud!"
Barney," Uh, L-Lily, uh, talk about your open marriage."," And so bourgeois. Many of plays are about the bourgeois. And ennui. And one rock opera about... a frozen yogurt shop.  Okay. Well, after a long day of style meetings and photo sh**t and being way too mean to my assistant, I sometimes bang an underwear model."
Barney, Let's do sh*ts.," What?  Uh, no, thank you, Barney. I have that fishing trip with J.J. early tomorrow. I... I better take it easy."
Barney, No. Don't you remember what you said to me when I was a kid? Never stop partying.," Uh, no, thank you, Barney. I have that fishing trip with J.J. early tomorrow. I... I better take it easy.  I said that? To a six-year-old? I don't remember that."
Barney," You don't remember the last thing you said to me when I was a kid? Well... you know, why don't you just go back home?", I said that? To a six-year-old? I don't remember that.  But I want to hang out with you.
Barney," Yeah, well, I want to hang out with Crazy Jerry, not Stay-at-Home Jerome.", But I want to hang out with you.  Fine. You want Crazy Jerry?(He drinks four sh*ts)There! You got him! I apologize... it might take a few minutes to kick in.
Barney, Can you believe it? This is awesome!," Hey, sugar! Five beers for the table, a Seven-and-Seven for me, and your ten digits for this guy here! Tonight Crazy Jerry's gonna burn this disco down! Whoo! Wa-hah!  Barney, how is that awesome?"
Barney, I finally know what it's like to be embarrassed by my dad.," Barney, how is that awesome?  So you really believe that if we were in an open marriage that you would do better than me?"
Barney," Hey, uh, hey, Jerry, y... you really want to be out here like this?"," So our usual wager. Deal.  Oh, sorry, small-town preacher from the Midwest, is there a law against dancing?"
Barney," No, of course not. I... I just..."," Oh, sorry, small-town preacher from the Midwest, is there a law against dancing?  Oh, this club blows. Let's h*t the greatest party in the world, the streets of New York!"
Barney," Yeah! Let's do it! Uh, maybe fix the tie. But mostly, party!"," Oh, this club blows. Let's h*t the greatest party in the world, the streets of New York!  Okay, Jerry's gone; Let's break up."
Barney," (laughing): Hey, hey! There we go!"," You want to fight me? Well, I'll fight you, dummy! You don't even know!  Oh, look what I just ripped out of the ground!"
Barney, Oh...!," Oh, look what I just ripped out of the ground!  I just puked on the hood of that... police car! (Laughing)"
Barney," It's okay, Dad. I never thought tonight would be so awesome! So... next stop, strip club. The Lusty Leopard has a special..."," Too bad your playwright friend isn't a lawyer. Barney, I'm so sorry. I'm afraid this is what it's like hanging out with Crazy Jerry.  Oh, for corn's sake, Barney, I'm not drunk!"
Barney, What?," Oh, for corn's sake, Barney, I'm not drunk!  I told you, I don't party anymore, and you wouldn't take no for an answer. So... I used a little... sleight-of-hand... to make you think otherwise."
Barney, Whoa!," Here you go.  Bottoms up, amigo!"
Barney, But all those crazy things you did.," Bottoms up, amigo!  Do you happen to remember what a magician's best friend is?"
Barney, A drunk audience.," Do you happen to remember what a magician's best friend is?  You want to fight me? Well, I'll fight you, dummy!"
Barney," No, no, no. You don't even know! Right here!"," You want to fight me? Well, I'll fight you, dummy!  Look. Look what I just ripped out of the ground!"
Barney, Oh...!, Look. Look what I just ripped out of the ground!  What just happened?
Barney, What just happened?, Oh...!  I... I just puked on the hood of that... (siren blares)...police car.
Barney," Well, why do all those things?"," I... I just puked on the hood of that... (siren blares)...police car.  I figured if I showed you what... never stop partying really looked like, you'd realize you can't do it forever. (sighs heavily) Oh, well."
Barney, You lied to me all night for your own selfish reasons? Daddy...!," I figured if I showed you what... never stop partying really looked like, you'd realize you can't do it forever. (sighs heavily) Oh, well.  I wanted to hang out with you... you're my son. And since you didn't want to come with me and J.J. On that fishing tri... Fishing trip. I'll never make it back in time now."
Barney," Hey, you know, a... a pretty good magician like you probably knows how to, say, get out of a standard set of handcuffs.", I wanted to hang out with you... you're my son. And since you didn't want to come with me and J.J. On that fishing tri... Fishing trip. I'll never make it back in time now.  Perhaps.
Barney," Well, here's something you didn't know... I'm a pretty good magician, too.(They escape and run away)Abracadabra!", Perhaps.  Congratulations!
Barney, We need someplace to hide.," Hi, Robin. Could I have your phone number?  Where?"
Barney," No, Jerry, this is not the time to go to another club! We've got to get you back home in time for that trip. But there's no more trains, there's no cabs."," Where?  Well, uh... I do have a few driving students in the city."
Barney, Step on it! Jerry...," Well, uh... I do have a few driving students in the city.  Do not step on it."
Barney," Jerry, we have got to get you home in time for that fishing trip.", Do not step on it.  The laws are there to protect...
Barney, This is no time for laws!," The laws are there to protect...  Buckle up, Barney."
Barney, I am not going to buckle up!," Buckle up, Barney.  I am your father! You will listen to me!"
Barney, How did you do it?, And her fianc'? The guy's like a two.  Do what?
Barney," How did you become this? I mean, I love my life, but... I'm not sure I like loving it. Sure, strip clubs...", Do what?  You're drifting.
Barney," Hey, I'm trying to open up to you..."," You're drifting.  No, Mrs. Perkins, you're drifting! Go on, Barney."
Barney," When I think about going for anything more than that, I look at my life, and who I am, and... I'm too far gone. I'm broken."," No, Mrs. Perkins, you're drifting! Go on, Barney.  Son, I was far more broken than you'll ever be. And look at me now. Don't get me wrong... settling down is... a challenge. It's the biggest challenge of your life."
Barney,So how do you do it?," Son, I was far more broken than you'll ever be. And look at me now. Don't get me wrong... settling down is... a challenge. It's the biggest challenge of your life.  A magician never reveals his greatest trick. But I'll give you a hint. You gotta meet the right girl. Who knows? Maybe you'll meet her tomorrow."
Barney,Maybe I've met her already.," A magician never reveals his greatest trick. But I'll give you a hint. You gotta meet the right girl. Who knows? Maybe you'll meet her tomorrow.  And park. And emergency brake. I did have a good time tonight. And hey, if you want to go fishing, we got room in the boat."
Barney,Maybe some other time.," And park. And emergency brake. I did have a good time tonight. And hey, if you want to go fishing, we got room in the boat.  Okay. Oh, and, uh... thanks for taking such good care of this. It means a lot to me that you kept it safe all these years."
Barney,I'm going fishing with my dad.," Okay. Oh, and, uh... thanks for taking such good care of this. It means a lot to me that you kept it safe all these years.  This... sucks."
Barney, This... sucks.,I'm going fishing with my dad.
Barney," Invitations for the demolition of The Arcadian. As head of the project, I get to decide how we knock it down. I'm torn between training an actual coyote to use an ACME dynamite plunger, or hooking up a fuse to Eddie Van Halen's guitar that goes off the second he hits the last note to Hot For Teacher. Barney! Barney! Bar... No, no. I'm going to go coyote."," If you want to get back at those jerks, I have a proposition for you.  Wait. While no one wants to see a, uh, coyote wearing a little hard hat more than me, remember: Zoey's protest could still shut your whole project down."
Barney," Oh, come on. Zoey's not shutting anything down, standing out there with her stupid megaphone, screaming in the wind; butt cheeks trembling with fury; her perky breasts heaving; her self-righteous nipples..."," Wait. While no one wants to see a, uh, coyote wearing a little hard hat more than me, remember: Zoey's protest could still shut your whole project down.  Dude, that's my girlfriend."
Barney," Point is, we are taking her and The Arcadian down. Am I right, Teddy Westside?"," Dude, that's my girlfriend.  You know it."
Barney," Glad to know she's also mouthy in a good way. What up? Dude, that's his girlfriend."," Okay. See, that's so weird to me. One second you're defending Zoey, and the next, you're talking about her going down.  Isn't it tough dating the woman that's trying to prevent your building from being built?"
Barney," Not only do you quit the job I stuck my neck out to get you, now you sabotage the project I'm in charge of? Is this because I brushed Lily's boob with my elbow, the other day?"," Listen, um, I hate to go up against my two best friends, but... I really, I really need this right now. I mean, we're, we're cool, right?  That was on purpose!"
Barney, I mean this is really like...," That was on purpose!  Barney, please..."
Barney, No. I' was... I was..., Barney! Your wife just called from the hospital! It's a boy!  This went on for days.
Barney, Congratulations. You're about to be the 250th girl that Barney has slept with.," This went on for days.  Pfff. Try 283. 250 was months ago. No, no, no. No, I mean, you're totally 250, baby. No, don't.(The girl leaves)"
Barney," Pfff. Try 283. 250 was months ago. No, no, no. No, I mean, you're totally 250, baby. No, don't.(The girl leaves)"," Congratulations. You're about to be the 250th girl that Barney has slept with.  Oh, bye-bye."
Barney, Are you sure it doesn't taste like anything else?," Ah, yes... the sweet, smoky taste of victory.  That's it!"
Barney, Kent! Kent!," That's it!  Oh, God! Ow... Why would you do that to your own jacket?!"
Barney," That's what you get, you traitor!"," Oh, God! Ow... Why would you do that to your own jacket?!  Oh, really? Really?"
Barney, Yeah. Really.," Oh, really? Really?  Really. That... what..."
Barney," I'm a B-plus. My whole life, I was hoping to be an A, and I'm a B-plus. And I'm okay with that."," Ten, nine, eight...  Happy New Year!"

Barney, Show me chicken wings!," Hey, where are our chicken wings?  Good order, Ted! Good order!"
Barney, Do you know what I had to do to get you that job?, I-I guess. That... seems like a whole other thing. We need a drink that will start a fight.  Do you know what I had to do to will myself to show up every day?
Barney," What, wear a wrinkled suit and not give a damn about what your hair looked like?", Do you know what I had to do to will myself to show up every day?  I showed up with wet hair once! Once!
Barney," Oh, my God."," I showed up with wet hair once! Once!  Well, here we are. I had a reservation at a four-star inn overlooking the ocean but, uh... How can that compete with such a beautiful, magnificent hotel? Welcome to The Arcadian. So here's the deal. If you can last until sunrise in your precious Arcadian, I'll join your side."
Barney," Ever since my father walked out on my childhood, I've had serious abandonment issues. You walking out on me like that..."," See, ever since the death of my father, I have been drawn to the idea of preservation. That's why The Arcadian speaks to me.  Oh God, I didn't even think of that..."
Barney," It made me wonder, What could I have done to make him stay?"," Oh God, I didn't even think of that...  Look, you didn't do anything wrong. It wasn't you, Barney."
Barney, That's what everyone keeps saying but people just keep leaving me.," Look, you didn't do anything wrong. It wasn't you, Barney.  Wow. That got real o'clock."

Barney, You have some coffee? So I can throw it in this traitor's face?," Morning. Who wants breakfast?  Oh, yeah? Hey! Hey! Do you guys have some pancakes, because I... would really like some pancakes. They're fantastic. Let's be honest, I love them. But I hate this guy!"
Barney," I love you. Uh, no. N-not right..."," I love you.  Carl, a round of champagne."
Barney," What kind of dirtbag doesn't stand by his best friends, but instead sides with some self-righteous bitch with a pointless cause and a megaphone?"," We gave them one drink too many. They must've blacked out and forgotten the whole thing.  Dude. That's my girlfriend. And you know what? I'm on her side now, too."
Barney," Whoa, whoa, you have got to be kidding me. Ted..."," Dude. That's my girlfriend. And you know what? I'm on her side now, too.  Okay, what drink can fix this?"
Barney," Okay, okay. A couple of things. Lily, how'd I do?", And she hasn't since.  Nailed it.
Barney," Secondly, Ted, I'm sorry I said mean things about Zoey. Are you really going to walk away from this project just because you're mad at me?"," Nailed it.  It's not because I'm mad at you. Barney, The Arcadian was designed by a guy named John Clifford Larrabee. And even though he's been d*ad for half a century, it's my duty, architect to architect, to keep his work alive. Please tell me a little part of you understands."
Barney, I understand. Zoey has magic lady bits.," It's not because I'm mad at you. Barney, The Arcadian was designed by a guy named John Clifford Larrabee. And even though he's been d*ad for half a century, it's my duty, architect to architect, to keep his work alive. Please tell me a little part of you understands.  What?"
Barney," Zoey's lady bits... are magic, and that's how she controls your mind. You see, every few hundred millennia, lady bits leap forward..."," What?  I know you're only just getting started, but this is already gross."
Barney, I once knew such a girl.," I know you're only just getting started, but this is already gross.  It was last call. In this very bar."
Barney, It was last call. In this very bar., I once knew such a girl.  What...?! No... What?!...No... What?!
Barney, What...?! No... What?!...No... What?!," It was last call. In this very bar.  Um... thank you for, um, not using a first name in that story."
Barney, Come on. This is so about the girl.," Barney, this is about the building.  Okay, fine. It's about the girl! I am doing this for Zoey! I'm in love with her. Look, I know it's early, but there is a very good chance Zoey might be the mother of my children. So, in addition to doing this for John Clifford Larrabee, I'm also doing this for Luke and Leia."
Barney," Oh, you're not sorry now, Ted Mosby. But you will be. You... will... be. (laughing harder and louder) That's how you do an evil laugh. Ciao for now."," Not if I knock down her favorite building, she isn't. Barney, I'm sorry.  Now, kids, you remember Arthur Hobbs, Barney and Marshall's old boss at GNB? Well, Arthur was going through a divorce and taking it kind of hard."
Barney," Hi, Arthur. Everything okay?"," Now, kids, you remember Arthur Hobbs, Barney and Marshall's old boss at GNB? Well, Arthur was going through a divorce and taking it kind of hard.  No, everything's not okay. My stupid wife got custody of Tugboat. God, I should have kept her hidden in a cage in the basement."
Barney, Isn't that animal cruelty?," No, everything's not okay. My stupid wife got custody of Tugboat. God, I should have kept her hidden in a cage in the basement.  I'm talking about my wife."
Barney," Oh. That's fine, then. So listen, you know Ted, the architect?"," I'm talking about my wife.  Yeah, I know your friend Ted."
Barney," So, if Ted stood up at that big meeting tomorrow and said that he thought The Arcadian should be a landmark... You wouldn't just f*re him, would you?(laughing uncomfortably)Right? You wouldn't just... You wouldn't just... yeah..."," Yeah, I know your friend Ted.  No, Barney. I wouldn't just f*re him. I'd also f*re you."
Barney, Come again for Big Fudge?," No, Barney. I wouldn't just f*re him. I'd also f*re you.  Can you believe that?! I can't be unemployed, Robin! My job is my identity; It's who I am. It gives me the confidence I need to convince girls I'm a fighter pilot."
Barney," Can you believe that?! I can't be unemployed, Robin! My job is my identity; It's who I am. It gives me the confidence I need to convince girls I'm a fighter pilot.", Come again for Big Fudge?  I-I don't understand. Why would he f*re you?
Barney, I don't understand. Why would you f*re me?, I-I don't understand. Why would he f*re you?  Have you already forgotten how Mosby got that job?
Barney, By being the best architect available?, Have you already forgotten how Mosby got that job?  No.
Barney, By... being Latino?, No.  No. Let me refresh your memory. We were in this very room.
Barney," Guys, I'm telling you, if Ted Mosby isn't fantastic, f*re me.", No. Let me refresh your memory. We were in this very room.  Damn it! I was kidding?
Barney, Damn it! I was kidding?," Guys, I'm telling you, if Ted Mosby isn't fantastic, f*re me.  I'm not kidding! Oh, by the way, Arthur, uh, how are things with you and your wife?"
Barney," I'm not kidding! Oh, by the way, Arthur, uh, how are things with you and your wife?"," Damn it! I was kidding?  Really good. In fact, I just put all my assets in her name. Smartest thing I've ever done."
Barney," We'll end up out of a job, all thanks to some stupid, only sort of awesome lion head."," Yeah.  Better get used to that lion head. As of tomorrow, it's gonna be there till the end of times. And all because of my sweet, sweet rhymes."
Barney, We should totally buy a bar!, What are we gonna do? We should buy a bar.  We should absolutely totally buy a bar!
Barney," The only court where you show up, then get served.", I'll allow it!  Ho! You're judged by a jury of your beers.
Barney," Oh, this ought to be good."," I don't know, homegirl is pretty diabolical. If there is a plan that'll get us out of this, it's somewhere inside this butter churn. She'll think of it. I'm just gonna sit here... and watch it happen.(Lily starts to jiggle)And she's got it! Lily, what's the plan?  And then Lily told us her plan."
Barney," Oh, this is good!", And then Lily told us her plan.  We have to find Arthur right now.
Barney," Hey, Arthur!"," What is so difficult about this?! Tugboat figured this out in, like, five minutes. This is bush league!  Oh, cute dog!"
Barney," Listen, Arthur, Marshall's wife has an idea for how we can save, not saving The Arcadian."," No! Tugboat, my other dog, that was a cute dog. This little disappointment is nothing but a cheap facsimile. I said it! Yeah, my love is reserved for dogs that go to the bathroom on command instead of wasting my time!  Oh, his wife has an idea. Let me tell you about wives, okay? They leave you and take your best friend with them. You're not Tugboat! You'll never be Tugboat!"
Barney," Uh... Hey, Arthur?"," Oh, his wife has an idea. Let me tell you about wives, okay? They leave you and take your best friend with them. You're not Tugboat! You'll never be Tugboat!  I guess this one's kind of cute or whatever. So... so what's the idea?"
Barney, Dibs.," Okay, first hear my demands. One, Ted and Barney keep their jobs. Two, when you guys do finally blow up The Arcadian, one of them gets to push the button.  Fine! What's the idea?"
Barney," I don't know, she may have been right about that lion's head. It gave The Arcadian a regal elegance. Then again, it goes really nice with my duvet.(He takes out a normal size screw driver)I hope I used the right screws."," Okay, you don't have to hold back anymore. You may now say what you really think of Zoey."
Barney, I want to press it!, I want to press the button to blow up The Arcadian!  I want to press it!
Barney, I want to press it!," I want to press it!  Guys, I dated you both, and neither of you is good at pressing or even finding the button. After some awkward pawing around, that building's going to fake an implosion, say, Baby, that was great and go to sleep."
Barney, She means you. I want to press it! I'm gonna press it!," Guys, I dated you both, and neither of you is good at pressing or even finding the button. After some awkward pawing around, that building's going to fake an implosion, say, Baby, that was great and go to sleep.  It's just a button, okay? Can we just talk about something else, please?"
Barney," You know what might... make you feel better, buddy?"," Don't worry, we're not. I just, I feel bad Zoey's having such a hard time.  I'm not letting you press the button."
Barney, I want to press the button!, I'm not letting you press the button.  You're not pressing the button! It's my button!
Barney, Yeah. Getting to stand next to me while I press the button. That is going to be legend... wait for it...dary adjacent. Legendary adjacent!," Hey, Mr. Architect, big day for you tomorrow, huh?  You okay?"
Barney," Are these people Irish, Polish, blondes... what are we dealing with here?"," 50,000 lightbulbs! What if this one's too bright? What if this one flickers and gives everyone a weird headache? Do you know how many people it takes to change 50,000 lightbulbs?  There's just-- there's so many decisions to be made. What if I make all the wrong ones and my building just sucks?"
Barney, Not possible. Your building is new. And I have one rule: New is always better., There's just-- there's so many decisions to be made. What if I make all the wrong ones and my building just sucks?  You can't keep saying you have one rule if they're always different rules.
Barney," Ah, but new is always better is my oldest rule, which makes it the best."," You can't keep saying you have one rule if they're always different rules.  Hi, Marsh."
Barney," Oh, hey, buddy."," Hi, Marsh.  Hey. Everything okay?"
Barney, I wonder what end it's coming out of Lily right now., I know. I just said that you had the sniffles. No one is picturing anything but little red-nosed you under a blankie with some hot tea.  I bet it's her tushie.
Barney," I bet it's both. Hey, speaking of expl*si*n... enough already, Ted! That button's mine!"," I bet it's her tushie.  Yeah, fine, okay."
Barney," I got you this job, so I... Say what?"," Yeah, fine, okay.  Whatever. It's yours. I gotta run.(Ted leaves the Bar)"
Barney, You...," Whatever. It's yours. I gotta run.(Ted leaves the Bar)  Hello?... Yes, it is.(To Lily)It's Bloom, Greenberg and Associates. They want me to come interview.(Lily throws up)I know it's risky to go, but this is the best environmental law firm in New York. It's my dream job.(Lily throws up)That's a great idea, babe. I'll ask them.(In his phone)Hey, is it at all possible, could I come in on Monday?... Okay, I'll, I'll see you at 5:00.(Marshall hangs up)Thank you. I love and believe in you, too, baby."
Barney, Who's that from?, Why would Ted just give up the button like that? And he forgot his phone. See you in an hour.  Zoey. They're meeting for coffee. Ted's getting back together with her!
Barney, Why would Ted get back together with Zoey? He's doing great.," Zoey. They're meeting for coffee. Ted's getting back together with her!  After a breakup, we all think we're doing great. Sometimes the tiniest trigger can unravel you and send you crawling right back."
Barney," No, I refuse to believe that Ted is getting back with Zoey because of lightbulbs."," After a breakup, we all think we're doing great. Sometimes the tiniest trigger can unravel you and send you crawling right back.  Uh, Ted's gone back for less."
Barney," Ted, I only have one rule."," Bro.  But I can't reach the worst part.(He picks his phone and calls someone)Hi, Karen. Want to get coffee sometime?"
Barney, We've got to stop Ted. Where are they meeting?," Can... I... borrow... an adult diaper?  Okay, Zoey wrote, Meet me at 6:00, where it all began, where you gave me the orchid at the intersection."
Barney," Well, that's good. All we have to do is think back to the time Ted told us about his first date with Zoey."," Okay, Zoey wrote, Meet me at 6:00, where it all began, where you gave me the orchid at the intersection.  Amazing first date with Zoey! We met at the intersection...(The rest is unintelligible)"
Barney, You weren't listening either?," Aw, that's sweet.  I was in a coma. I mean, who pays attention to that sappy romantic crap?"
Barney, Lily!," I was in a coma. I mean, who pays attention to that sappy romantic crap?  Yeah, I wasn't listening, either. Ted really can go on about a bitch."
Barney, That's the intersection., Got it. Ted's at...(Lily runs to the bathroom and throws up)Oh... Ted's at Smith and Ninth Street.  That's in Brooklyn. How are we ever gonna get there in time?
Barney, Way ahead of ya., That's in Brooklyn. How are we ever gonna get there in time?  Hello!
Barney, I know. They're a total train wreck., I can't believe Ted's getting back together with Zoey.  Unmitigated disaster.
Barney," Yeah, almost as bad as us."," Worst couple ever.  We were a mess. Do you remember how awful I looked by the end? My hair was falling out, my skin was gray, my back was hunched."
Barney," What about me? I got so fat, at the end of a date, you'd unhook my bra."," We were a mess. Do you remember how awful I looked by the end? My hair was falling out, my skin was gray, my back was hunched.  You were the only boyfriend I ever motorboated."
Barney," Thank God we're not sentimental saps who panic and get back together. Seriously, why would people do that?", You were the only boyfriend I ever motorboated.  I guess I get it.
Barney, What do you mean?," I guess I get it.  Well, no matter how bad things got... Ted really did love Zoey for a minute there. Didn't he?"
Barney," Yeah... he did. And... she loved him, too. Didn't she?"," Well, no matter how bad things got... Ted really did love Zoey for a minute there. Didn't he?  Yeah, she did."
Barney, Maybe this isn't the intersection.," Okay, where the hell are they?  Well, maybe it is and we're too late. Man, I wish we'd gone to Brooklyn sooner."
Barney, She's alone! There's still time! But where the hell is Ted?," Across the street at the Intersection. So, uh, you guys... want to buy some weed or...?  Wait a minute. On their first date, he brought her an orchid. How much do you want to bet he's gonna do it again?"
Barney," Brilliant. But wait, he had a huge head start on us. There's no way he's still in there unless he spent a half an hour picking out the perfect orchid."," Wait a minute. On their first date, he brought her an orchid. How much do you want to bet he's gonna do it again?  Thanks, Julia! You know what? Let me see the pink lady slipper again.(He goes back inside)"
Barney, But... it's a mistake.," Look, Ted, the future is scary. But you can't just run back to the past because it's familiar. Yes, it's tempting.  You're right.(Ted stops an elderly woman who was about to enter the Intersection)Um, excuse me. Can you give this to the blonde sitting alone in there and tell her Ted's really sorry? Also... indirect sunlight. Don't overwater. Half a cup a week is more than enough.(The elderly woman enters and gives theflowers to a blonde sitting alone, but not the right one)No. Hi."
Barney, He is.," Okay, hotshot. Mr. Stinson. Who's gonna do the honors?  You sure?"
Barney, Yeah. You earned it., You sure?  All clear!
Barney, Always.," Hey, new is always better, right?  Ten, nine, eight..."
Barney," It's just a button. Can we talk about something else, please? (Barney sees Norah, Robin says something to him that we cant hear, then Barney walks up to Norah)Norah.", I'm proud of you for giving Ted the button. It meant a lot.  Hi.
Barney, How you been?, Hi.  Fine.
Barney," Look, I don't know why you would possibly say yes to this, but would you want to grab a cup of coffee with me sometime? 20 minutes. I was such a jerk to you. You can spend the entire time calling me every dirty name in the book.", Fine.  I speak four languages. I'm gonna need more than 20 minutes.
Barney," I'll call you. You look beautiful, by the way. And here I thought it was too late for sundresses."," I speak four languages. I'm gonna need more than 20 minutes.  It's never too late, Barney."
Barney, Challenge accepted.," It's never too late, Barney.  Best man? You're being summoned."
Barney, What do you think of this tie?," Geez, what now?(He goes inside, enters a room)I heard the groom needed me."
Barney, What do you think of this tie?," Children, if there is a major theme in this story, and I swear, it's almost, really, not quite at the end of the story.This is timing. The timing makes all the difference. For example, I never met your mother if it was not for a wedding.The last of the weddings that I thought would be.  Thank you, God. Barney Stinson needs you just before her marriage, is that there must be a d*ad prost*tute in the closet, right?"
Barney, This one is better?," Thank you, God. Barney Stinson needs you just before her marriage, is that there must be a d*ad prost*tute in the closet, right?  The tie is well, and you know, this is perfectly normal pinball shortly before his marriage."
Barney," I'm not scared. It's just that I think once I'd put this tie, I could never remove it. I should wear it again and again. And of course this tie is fine now, but how I will cope when it becomes big and it annoy me? Do I made a mistake? Is what I would have been happier with the other tie? Ted, I can tell you a big secret?"," The tie is well, and you know, this is perfectly normal pinball shortly before his marriage.  Yeah, sure."
Barney, I do not really talk about the tie.," Yeah, sure.  Yeah, I realized that Barney."
Barney, I wonder if this will be a disaster. And if it was the worst of all marriage?," Yeah, I realized that Barney.  Impossible. It has already been the worst of all marriage."
Barney, That of Punchy., Impossible. It has already been the worst of all marriage.  Marshall has really ruined all that.
Barney," Yeah, no problem, of course.", Hi. Guys before you go that you bother to read my toast for the wedding?  Ok
Barney, Woow., Ok  There are several different versions.
Barney," Ted, you can h*t you something else to this marriage.Let the big binder. The only thing you have to bring it to Cleveland."," Oh, not that much. Now I am a total disaster for all my old high school friends. And a lot of people in Finland are the big stuff. This is why I have to type this toast.  This fall I became the youngest designer in the history of New York by building a skyscraper. This earned me a brilliant article in a magazine. I plan to frame it. Uncle Barney had different plans."
Barney," Here's your speech. In single file, girls. No big.", This fall I became the youngest designer in the history of New York by building a skyscraper. This earned me a brilliant article in a magazine. I plan to frame it. Uncle Barney had different plans.  This is ridiculous.
Barney," Yeah, you're right. This is Cleveland. In single file, girls.", This is ridiculous.  I will not Punchy's wedding to brag... cover of a magazine.
Barney, I'll call you.," Children, you remember Nora. But the other day...  It's never too late, Barney."
Barney, I did not call.," Or you called? It's not that I want to know. So what? I do not care. You did?  Slim, Barney. I was really, really, really for both of you.Who wants chicken wings?"
Barney," I'm not a wimp. Nora wanted a professional. Not me.That's it. And yes, Robin, I want chicken wings."," Me. Or maybe we should make the hot sauce on Barney, now that's a sissy.  Cannibal."
Barney," Stand ready, Cleveland. The last guy who has conned you so hard and then disappeared was LeBron James.", So we all went to my hometown where we had planned to celebrate the marriage of Punchy. Uncle Barney had other plans.  You're going to try to make you anybody here?
Barney, What?," You're going to try to make you anybody here?  My God, Barney, tonight is a magical night between the annoying friend of Ted and that is what this-face. A little respect."
Barney," It's not just be someone. This is a market survey. You see, my legendary success rate of 83%..."," My God, Barney, tonight is a magical night between the annoying friend of Ted and that is what this-face. A little respect.  17. He always reverse."
Barney,"... never happens by accident. Each technique used to drag a woman has been thoroughly field tested. By eliminating improper techniques in small markets like Cleveland. I know which will go to New York. For example, tonight marks the inauguration of the escaped prisoner. Do prisoners on the run are sexy?"," 17. He always reverse.  No, no."
Barney, We'll never know unless I try tonight.," No, no.  Schmosby! Oh! Shit head! What's up?!"
Barney," Prisoners on the run are not sexy. At the same time it was a faulty concept. Next step, the patient zero."," During the season of super bowl, but if they mean the super bowl. Go Vikings.  Lily, you go getting drunk tonight."
Barney," Wait, wait, wait, before you leave, please do respond to this survey to help me better to seduce you in the future.What does not work for you in this game of seduction? Does A do not you think that I hold a bailiff of the world? B or fingernails disgusts you? (He shows her nails, very long and the girl goes away) Sea..."," You're more drunk than I thought. I mean, look at this type.  Eager to hear your toast, Schmosby."
Barney," Take that. Shows them how much you're great. Say your ad, not ashamed, say that."," Yes, everyone encourages you. Plus some new friends from Finland. Hey, good luck, Schmos.  I've told you, I'm not here to brag, ok?"
Barney," It does not work for you because A vampires are offside, B or pretend that I invented Facebook was a bit too?", Really? That's why he tries to Lebron anything that moves?  You're the reason why he never called Nora. You're the reason why he only tests tonight. And you're the reason why he continues to try to impress. Chemistry.
Barney," I know what you gonna say. Show in Cleveland, how it goes."," Well. Barney, just to make things clear...  Barney... I..."
Barney," Sorry. Oh, my God, this is Nora. She finally ended up reminding me."," Barney... I...  Wait, you said you'd never recalled."
Barney," I lied. I called, like, five times. Wait, wait! You guys you know better than anyone how I show this stuff. Will you help me please? I would like just once to see what it feels like when you do not quite fair."," Wait, you said you'd never recalled.  Yeah."
Barney, Hi Nora. Thank you for reminding me. The reason I'm calling..., Yeah.  To tell you how I feel.
Barney, To tell you how I feel., To tell you how I feel.  I know it did not work the first time...
Barney, I know it did not work the first time..., I know it did not work the first time... ... and it makes no sense...
Barney,... and it makes no sense...,... and it makes no sense... ... but I can not help thinking that goes well together.
Barney,... but I can not help thinking that goes well together.,... but I can not help thinking that goes well together.  Is there a part of you that wants to try again?
Barney, Is there a part of you that wants to try again?," Is there a part of you that wants to try again?  Baby, I can not do that. I have to tell someone that we are pregnant."
Barney, Oh! Oh!, For real.  A little attention everyone! This is the time for which we are all here tonight. The speech Schmosby!
Barney," I chose the right tie, huh?"," No marriage will be as bad as that one, huh?  You've nailed. And be glad it is not the tie-duck. Oh, the tie-duck."
Barney," You're a good best man, Ted. You'll cry during the toast, right?"," This is a good story. I will return. We are not even close to the end.  Oh, I'll cry too."
Barney, Between.," Oh, I'll cry too.  Ted, the bride wants to see you. Seriously? Will you be wearing this tie?"
Barney," Oh, nothing. I must have coffee with Nora. She is still angry, so I need some sympathy points. She loves musicals, so I'll tell him that I fell off stage during a performance of Man of La Mancha. What do you think?", What happened to your leg?  Lose the cast.
Barney, A one-man show... I love it!, Lose the cast.  Let us be clear... this woman is angry against you because you lied to him. So your solution is to claim that you broke your leg?
Barney," You're right. A cervical neck brace! Thank you, Lil. I should have to talk to you soon. I trained all day with these crutches and one who has left in my hall is likely to need it."," Let us be clear... this woman is angry against you because you lied to him. So your solution is to claim that you broke your leg?  Well, I have good news. As you know, I recently decided to start out and see the girls."
Barney," Hi Nora, thank you for coming."," The next night, Barney and Nora saw each other for a coffee.Fortunately, without the neck brace ridiculous.  What happened to your neck?"
Barney," My naked...? Oh, that's nothing. I was playing in a One Man Show at Fiddler. There was this scene..."," What happened to your neck?  Wow, this one has a beautiful chest."
Barney," What? Where? Oh, and shit."," Wow, this one has a beautiful chest.  Breasts..."
Barney," Wait, Nora, waiting... No, please. I'm sorry.", Breasts...  What is wrong with you? What kind of people need to lie like that?
Barney," Someone who likes you, really. And suspicious, and probably accurately you do it over more later, and therefore he feels the need... I'm sorry, you spoke of this fantastic pair of tits, right? Because I seek, and I do not see them."," What is wrong with you? What kind of people need to lie like that?  I just had two rencards following. With two adorable girls, four cappuccinos and wait... (2 minutes later...) I do not know which was the best. Here are the girls: Jessica is a student in Rhode Island, she traveled around the world, speaks four languages and plays the piano. Claire and fought for the bill. So I do not know. It is t*rture. You see, the two girls have the potential to be really special. They both deserve a second round."
Barney," Okay, I did not know. Mea culpa. So, from now, more lies. I never lie to you. I'm serious. Ask me anything.", Let me clarify something for you. I do not date guys who lie to me.  OK Have you ever managed to get in bed with a woman that you lied?
Barney, Have I ever... If I'm totally honest... Yes., OK Have you ever managed to get in bed with a woman that you lied?  More than once?
Barney," More than once... Wow, this is... I guess if we... so, technically, there were a number of times I've lied to a woman to sleep with her.", More than once?  They were worth what?
Barney," Nine or ten for most. There has been a 4 once. It was an easy girl.But, Nora, after that, I had to flee so fast. Honesty is good.", They were worth what?  What was the lie?
Barney, You want me to tell all the lies I have told to put a woman in my bed?, What was the lie?  A bed or any other place where you're sent into the air.
Barney, You are good.," A bed or any other place where you're sent into the air.  Pete, Pete. Hey!"
Barney," I do not have time to explain how I got there. I just need someone to suck the poison. The surgeon gave me a new face, darling. You realize that I am alive? My name is David Beckham. If I castais only the white swan, is the role for you. No, I am a lesbian. What I wear is just very realistic."," Meanwhile, Barney continued to list every lie he used to sleep.  Ok, let's move. What was the worst? The best of the worst? The cream of the crop?"
Barney," Oh, once I am the soul man. There was this pretty girl who only go out with black."," Ok, let's move. What was the worst? The best of the worst? The cream of the crop?  Barney! Oh no, I knew it.Ted, Lily and Robin are in the apartment."
Barney," And that made all the lies related to space. Let the world of sports. Oh wait, I forgot for a space: I was bitten by a snake space. You have to suck all the poison around my..."," I was going to the darts, but it's Edward bottles to money!  Okay, Barney, I have things to work tomorrow at 8 am which means I have just enough time to spend 11h in my shower to wash away all that."
Barney," So that was cool. I can remember, or...?"," Okay, Barney, I have things to work tomorrow at 8 am which means I have just enough time to spend 11h in my shower to wash away all that.  Barney, you're funny, beautiful, and really nice. But you are also a sociopath."
Barney," Well, I count three for and one against."," Barney, you're funny, beautiful, and really nice. But you are also a sociopath.  How can you still believe you have a chance with me?"
Barney," Because you are sat here all night. You could leave, but you did not. Listen, Nora, these lies, it was the old me. But I swear I try to change.You... make me want to change.", How can you still believe you have a chance with me?  How I know this is not a lie?
Barney, I will prove it. I'll show you how much I'm serious. I will not leave this restaurant as I have not got a second date with you., How I know this is not a lie?  Goodbye Barney.
Barney, I do not laugh. It is a restaurant 24h/24. I will stay forever if necessary. And I will. Just water for me please.," Goodbye Barney.  Ok, so the red bar indicates the level of attractiveness, blue, intellectual stimulation, green, emotional connection, yellow, compatibility aspirations of life, and purple, so she tried to pay or not."
Barney, Oh! Hi guys! Oh! My neck! Uh... oh! Hey! Look at this!," But if he did, you would love all the same.
